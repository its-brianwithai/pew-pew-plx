## 2. 📊 Quality Rubric

| ID | Category | Standard / Expectation | How to Measure / Verify |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Code Quality** |
| `QS-CODE-01` | **Style & Formatting** | All code must adhere to the `[e.g., PSR-12, Google Java Style Guide]` and project-specific conventions. | Passes automated linter checks with zero errors. Code review sign-off. |
| `QS-CODE-02` | **Documentation** | All public methods, complex logic, and API endpoints must have clear, concise comments/documentation explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values. | Manual code review. Documentation coverage tools (if applicable). |
| `QS-CODE-03` | **Test Coverage** | Critical business logic must have a unit test coverage of at least `[e.g., 80%]`. | Code coverage reports from the CI/CD pipeline. |
| `QS-CODE-04` | **Simplicity** | Avoid premature optimization and overly complex solutions. Prefer simple, readable code over clever, obscure code. | Manual code review. Peer feedback. |
| **UI/UX Quality** |
| `QS-UI-01` | **Design Fidelity** | Implemented UI should be "pixel-perfect" when compared to the final Figma/Sketch mockups. | Visual comparison during review. Use of tools like Pixel-perfect extensions. |
| `QS-UI-02` | **Responsiveness** | All UI components must render correctly and be fully functional on standard viewport sizes (e.g., 360px, 768px, 1280px, 1920px). | Manual testing on different devices/emulators. |
| `QS-UI-03` | **Consistency** | Use components, colors, and typography from the established Design System. Do not introduce one-off styles. | Review against the Design System documentation. |
| **Documentation & Reporting** |
| `QS-DOC-01` | **Clarity** | All reports (e.g., Result Report) and internal documentation must be written in clear, unambiguous language, understandable by its intended audience. | Peer review. |
| `QS-DOC-02` | **Completeness** | The Result Report must be fully completed, with no empty sections. All changes must be documented. | Manual check against the template during review. |
| **Process Quality** |
| `QS-PROC-01` | **Traceability** | All work must be traceable back to a specific requirement, story, or task. | Commit messages should reference ticket IDs. Pull requests should link to the relevant story. |
