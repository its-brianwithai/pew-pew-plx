### Naming conventions and content rules

- **Blocks**
  - Files in `templates/blocks/` must be suffixed with `-block.md`
  - Use dash-based bullet lists and dash-based checkbox lists
  - Avoid using the word "for" in instructional steps; prefer concise imperative phrasing

- **Wikilinks**
   - Use `[[reference]]` for dynamic loading and `![[embed]]` when inline content insertion is desired
   - Embedded wikilinks must occupy their own line
   - Use `mdc:` links only inside Cursor rule files; in normal docs, prefer wikilinks per README guidance

- **Agents and prompts**
  - `agents/` are reusable compositions (persona + workflows + instructions + output formats); role-first and not task-bounded
  - `prompts/` are action-oriented invocations that may embed agents and blocks via wikilinks

- **Issues and workflows**
  - `issues/**` content should reference templates in `templates/outputs/` where applicable
  - `workflows/**` should align with `instructions/**` conventions
