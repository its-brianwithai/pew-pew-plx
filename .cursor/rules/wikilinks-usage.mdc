### Wikilinks usage

- **Standard wikilinks**
  - `[[component]]` resolves to dynamic loading at runtime after sync
  - Prefer for reusable references (e.g., instructions, workflows, templates)

- **Embedded wikilinks**
  - `![[component]]` inserts actual file content during sync
  - Must occupy their own line
  - Use when inline content is required in the artifact

- **Transformation (per README)**
  - `[[component]]` → `@path/to/component.md` for dynamic loading
  - `![[component]]` → inlined file content

- **Rule file links**
  - Use `mdc:` links only inside Cursor rule files to point at repo files
  - In normal docs, prefer wikilinks over raw paths
