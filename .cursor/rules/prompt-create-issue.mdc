### Create Issue prompt rules

- **Source**: [prompts/create-issue.md](mdc:prompts/create-issue.md)

- **Core philosophy**
  - Minimal first
  - Research second
  - Build iteratively through single, high-value questions
  - User controls depth and completion

- **Step 0 research**
  - Parse user request to extract only explicit statements
  - Search repository to find similar issues, related components, conventions
  - Understand domain and technical context
  - Do not add requirements from research; use findings to inform questions

- **Workflow requirements**
  - Step 1: Create minimal base with only explicit user input
  - Step 2: Present research findings without adding requirements
  - Step 3: Interactive refinement using one question at a time; after 3–5 questions ask whether to continue
  - Step 4: Section transition control with explicit A/B/C choice

- **Deliverables**
  - Minimal initial issue based on exact user request
  - Research findings
  - Iteratively refined sections
  - Actual file created on disk upon user confirmation

- **Acceptance criteria**
  - Initial issue contains only explicit requirements
  - Research informs questions without introducing assumptions
  - Single-question cadence with periodic continuation check
  - File created on disk when user confirms

- **Output format**
  - Format type: Markdown following `[[issue-template]]`
  - File location: `issues/{concept}/{number}-{CODE}-{title}/{description}-issue.md`
  - Conventions: `[[issue-creation-conventions]]`
  - Progressive structure: Title/description → Requirements → Actor Flow → Deliverables → Acceptance Criteria (only as user proceeds)

- **Must do**
  - Start with the minimum from the user’s words
  - Research the project before creating content
  - Ask single, high-value questions
  - Create the file when confirmed

- **Must not do**
  - Add requirements not mentioned by the user
  - Assume complex features without confirmation
  - Skip the research phase
  - Present the entire issue only in chat instead of creating the file
