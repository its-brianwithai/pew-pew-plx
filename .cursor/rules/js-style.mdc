### JavaScript style guide

- **Naming**
  - Use meaningful, descriptive names; avoid 1–2 character identifiers
  - Functions use verb/verb-phrase names; variables use noun/noun-phrase names
  - Prefer full words over abbreviations

- **Control flow**
  - Use guard clauses and handle error/edge cases early
  - Avoid deep nesting beyond 2–3 levels

- **Comments**
  - Write comments only where they add value; explain "why", not "how"
  - Do not add narration comments inside code

- **Formatting**
  - Match existing style; prefer multi-line over dense one-liners
  - Keep lines reasonably short and readable

- **CLI files**
  - Ensure CLI entry files include a shebang `#!/usr/bin/env node` and are executable
  - Main CLI: [bin/plx.js](mdc:bin/plx.js)
