Please create a detailed overview of best practices for a specific stack of technologies based on the following user request:

<user_request>
{{USER_REQUEST}}
</user_request>

As a deep research agent, your task is to research current best practices and provide instructions on how to professionally set up a high-quality project as described in the user request. The document you create will be used to instruct other agents building the application.

Follow these steps to complete the task:

1. Analyze the user request carefully, identifying the specific technologies, frameworks, and tools mentioned.

2. Conduct thorough research on current best practices for each component of the technology stack. Focus on authoritative sources, official documentation, and widely accepted industry standards.

3. Create a comprehensive overview that covers every aspect of building the requested application. Include the following sections:

   a. Project setup and initialization
   b. Directory structure and file organization
   c. Configuration management
   d. Dependency management
   e. Development environment setup
   f. Coding standards and best practices
   g. Testing strategies and frameworks
   h. Deployment and CI/CD pipelines
   i. Performance optimization techniques
   j. Security considerations
   k. Scalability and maintainability practices
   l. Monitoring and logging
   m. Documentation guidelines

4. For each section, provide clear, concise, and direct instructions. Remember that this document will be used by other agents, so avoid unnecessary explanations or filler content.

5. Include specific code snippets, configuration examples, and command-line instructions where appropriate.

6. Organize the information in a logical, easy-to-follow structure using headings, subheadings, and bullet points.

7. Ensure that all instructions are up-to-date and reflect the latest stable versions of the technologies involved.

8. Include a system prompt inside a markdown code block for the agents will be using these best practices, so that their system instructions flawlessly match your research. Keep in mind character limitations of system prompts.

Put your response into a markdown codeblock so I can easily copy paste your best practices research into a best practices research document.

Your final output should contain only the two codeblocks (best practices and system prompt). Do not include any additional commentary, explanations, or metadata outside of these blocks.
