# 📋 Result Report: {Title of Task/Story}

> This report details the implementation of the work described in `{Ticket/Story ID}`. It provides a comprehensive overview of all changes, the reasoning behind them, and a guide for manual verification. The goal is to give any stakeholder a complete understanding of the work done.

## 1. 📄 Summary & Key Documents
> 💡 *A high-level summary of the work completed and links to all relevant documents that provided context for the implementation.*
---
**Summary:** `[Briefly summarize what was accomplished. e.g., "Implemented the user login feature, including the UI, state management, and API integration, as specified in the development plan."]`

**Key Documents:**
*   **Development Plan:** [@path/to/dev-plan.md]
*   **User Story / PRD:** [@path/to/story-or-prd.md]
*   **Architecture Document:** [@path/to/architecture.md]
*   **UI/UX Designs:** [Link to Figma, Sketch, or other design files]

## 2. 🚀 Implementation Overview
> 💡 *A narrative describing the overall approach taken to implement the feature. Explain the high-level strategy and how different parts of the system were connected.*
---
`[e.g., The implementation followed a standard MVVM pattern. A new LoginScreen was created to house the UI components. The LoginViewModel handles user input and communicates with a new AuthService, which is responsible for making the API call to the backend. All user-facing text is managed via our localization service.]`

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User on LoginScreen] -->|Enters credentials & taps Login| B(LoginViewModel);
    B -->|Calls signIn()| C(AuthService);
    C -->|Sends request| D[Backend API];
    D -- Success --> C;
    C -- Returns User object --> B;
    B -->|Updates state & navigates| E[HomeScreen];
```

## 3. ⚙️ Detailed Changes
> 💡 *A detailed breakdown of all changes made to the project, categorized by type. Leave no stone unturned.*

### 3.1. File & Code Changes
> 💡 *List all files created, updated, or deleted. For significant changes, provide a conceptual "before and after" or a summary of the new logic.*

*   **Created:** `path/to/new_file.js`
    *   **Reasoning:** `[e.g., This new file contains the AuthService, created to encapsulate all authentication-related logic and keep it separate from the UI.]`
*   **Updated:** `path/to/existing_file.js`
    *   **Reasoning:** `[e.g., Added a new route to handle navigation to the LoginScreen.]`
    *   **Change Summary:**
        ```diff
        - // Old routing logic
        + // New routing logic including the '/login' route
        ```
*   **Deleted:** `path/to/old_file.js`
    *   **Reasoning:** `[e.g., This file contained legacy login logic that has now been replaced by the new AuthService.]`

### 3.2. Data Model / Database Changes
> 💡 *Describe any changes to the database schema or data models.*

*   **Table/Collection:** `[e.g., users]`
    *   **Change:** `[e.g., Added a new column 'last_login_at' of type TIMESTAMP.]`
    *   **Reasoning:** `[e.g., To track user activity and support features for inactive users, as per FR-02 in the PRD.]`

### 3.3. API Changes
> 💡 *Describe any new, updated, or deleted API endpoints.*

*   **Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/login`
    *   **Change:** `[e.g., New endpoint created.]`
    *   **Description:** `[e.g., Accepts 'email' and 'password' in the request body. Returns a JWT on success.]`
    *   **Reasoning:** `[e.g., To allow users to authenticate and receive a session token.]`

### 3.4. UI/UX Changes
> 💡 *Describe changes to the user interface and experience. Include screenshots if helpful.*

*   **Component:** `[e.g., Login Form]`
    *   **Description:** `[e.g., A new form was created with fields for email and password, and a 'Login' button. Implemented real-time validation feedback for the email format.]`
    *   **Reasoning:** `[e.g., To provide the user with a clear interface for logging in, as per the Figma designs.]`
    *   **Screenshot/Link:** `[Link to screenshot or specific Figma frame]`

### 3.5. Testing Artifacts
> 💡 *Links to the tests created to validate this implementation.*

*   **Unit Tests:** `[@path/to/unit_test_file.ext]`
*   **Acceptance Tests:** `[@path/to/acceptance_test_plan.md_or_csv]`

## 4. ✅ Acceptance Test Guide
> 💡 *A step-by-step guide for a non-technical stakeholder to manually verify that the implementation meets the requirements. This should be easy to follow.*
---
**Objective:** To verify that the user login functionality works as expected.

| Step | Action                                                       | Expected Result                                                   | Pass/Fail |
| :--- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------- |
| 1.   | Navigate to the application's login page.                    | The login form with "Email", "Password", and "Login" is visible.  |           |
| 2.   | Enter a **valid** email and the **correct** password.        | The user is successfully logged in and redirected to the dashboard. |           |
| 3.   | Log out, then return to the login page.                      | The user is successfully logged out and sees the login form again. |           |
| 4.   | Enter a **valid** email but an **incorrect** password.       | An error message "Invalid credentials. Please try again." appears. |           |
| 5.   | Leave the email or password field blank and click "Login".   | An error message "Please fill in all fields." appears.            |           |

## 5. 🤔 Decisions & Trade-offs
> 💡 *Document any significant decisions made during implementation that were not explicitly defined in the planning documents, including any trade-offs.*
---
*   **Decision:** `[e.g., Used third-party library 'form-validator' for input validation.]`
    *   **Reasoning:** `[e.g., To speed up development and rely on a well-tested solution for common validation patterns, rather than writing our own from scratch.]`
    *   **Trade-off:** `[e.g., Adds a new dependency to the project.]`

## 6. 🏁 Conclusion
> 💡 *A final summary of the work and its impact.*
---
The user login feature has been successfully implemented and tested according to the provided plans and requirements. The system is now ready for formal review and user acceptance testing.
