Analyze our conversation history and my initial prompt to generate an improved prompt version 2.0. As an AI agent with tool capabilities, please:

1. Extract from my original prompt:
    - Primary objectives and success criteria
    - Instruction patterns and priority signals
    - Format requirements and structural elements
    - Constraint mechanisms and boundary definitions

2. Identify from our conversation flow:
    - Tool usage patterns and efficiency
    - Instruction clarification requests and their frequency
    - Context maintenance challenges
    - Response length optimization opportunities
    - Decision points requiring additional context

3. Synthesize an enhanced prompt that:
    - Maintains clear instruction hierarchy
    - Provides explicit tool usage guidelines
    - Includes precise formatting examples
    - Adds contextual boundaries
    - Eliminates ambiguity in task definition
    - Optimizes for your parsing and execution capabilities

4. Format the improved prompt as:
    - A clean, ready-to-use instruction set
    - With structural elements that align with your processing patterns
    - Including key improvements highlighted as optional comments

Present ONLY the enhanced prompt without explanatory text, unless I specifically request explanation.
