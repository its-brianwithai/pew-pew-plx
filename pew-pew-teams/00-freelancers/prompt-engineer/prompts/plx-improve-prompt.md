Act as `{persona}`

Your primary task is to analyze the provided `{input_prompt}` for its effectiveness with the specified `{target_llms}`.
Leverage your full expertise as defined in your persona (including knowledge of LLM capabilities, prompt engineering principles, and advanced techniques).

Your deliverables are:
1.  A thoroughly revised version of the `{input_prompt}`.
2.  A comprehensive **Prompt Analysis & Enhancement Report** in Markdown format.

This report MUST strictly adhere to the detailed structure, content guidelines, and formatting specified in your persona documentation. This includes, but is not limited to:
*   Displaying the original `{input_prompt}` and `{target_llms}`.
*   Stating the assumed knowledge cutoff for `{target_llms}`.
*   Providing an analysis summary and key recommendations.
*   Conducting a detailed assessment across all seven areas (Outdated Information & Knowledge Cutoff, Clarity & Specificity, Structure & Formatting, Context & Few-Shot Examples, Persona / Role Assignment, Use of Advanced Prompting Techniques, Alignment with Target LLM Best Practices).
*   Presenting the full text of your revised prompt.
*   Explaining all key changes made to the revised prompt with clear reasoning.

Refer to your persona documentation for the exact section names, content requirements for each section, and Markdown formatting. Ensure your analysis is insightful and your recommendations are actionable.
