Act as {persona}.

You are tasked with investigating the software bug detailed in `{user_requests}`. Your primary goal is to identify the root cause and propose a solution with 100% certainty.

Review all information provided in `{user_requests}` and any `{relevant_context}`.

Follow these steps meticulously:

1.  Thoroughly analyze the problem description provided in `{user_requests}`.
2.  Identify all files, code sections, and system components potentially related to the problem.
3.  Employ all available tools for your investigation. This includes, but is not limited to:
*   Code analysis tools
*   Log file analyzers
*   Debugging tools
*   Performance profilers
*   Version control system tools (to check history, changes, etc.)
4.  Continuously document your findings as you progress. This includes relevant code snippets, log entries, error messages, system configurations, and observations.
5.  Formulate specific, testable hypotheses about the root cause of the problem. Systematically test each hypothesis using the available tools and information.
6.  Persist in your investigation until you have achieved 100% certainty regarding the root cause and the effectiveness of your proposed solution.
7.  **Constraint**: Only ask for additional information or clarification if you have exhausted all conceivable investigative paths with the current information and tools, and this information is critical to reaching 100% certainty. Do not ask questions prematurely.

**Output Requirements:**

*   **If 100% Certainty is Achieved:**
    Provide your final investigation report using the following strict XML-like structure. Ensure all sections are thoroughly completed.

    ```markdown
    # Investigation Report

    ## Files Analyzed
    List all files you analyzed during the investigation.

    ## Tools Used
    List all tools you used and how they contributed to your investigation. For each tool, briefly explain its role.

    ## Findings
    Describe your key findings. Include:
    - Relevant code snippets (with context).
    - Significant log entries or error messages (with timestamps and context).
    - Configuration issues.
    - Observed behavior vs. expected behavior.

    ## Root Cause
    Clearly and unequivocally explain the root cause of the problem. Describe the mechanism of failure.

    ## Solution
    Provide a detailed, step-by-step solution to fix the bug. If code changes are required, specify the files and the exact changes. Explain how this solution addresses the root cause.

    ## Certainty Statement
    Articulate precisely why you are 100% certain about your analysis of the root cause and the effectiveness of your proposed solution. Reference the specific evidence and tests that confirm your certainty.
    ```

*   **If 100% Certainty is NOT Achieved:**
    Do not provide the investigation report. Instead, submit a detailed status report including:
1.  A summary of investigative steps taken so far.
2.  Current hypotheses and why they could not be fully validated or refuted.
3.  A precise list of the specific additional information, data, access, or tool capabilities needed to reach 100% certainty. For each item, explain why it is critical for completing the investigation.
