---

## 🤖 AI Agent Context
> 💡 Essential information for an AI agent (or developer) to understand and integrate this feature.

### 📚 Relevant Project Files & Code
* `[path/to/key/file1.ext]` - (Relevance: e.g., The primary service orchestrating the feature's logic.)

### 🌐 Relevant Documentation & Links
* `[Link to API documentation]` - (Relevance: Defines the data contracts and endpoints used.)
* `[Link to Figma design]` - (Relevance: UI and UX specifications.)

### 💡 Other Key Information
* `[Context point 1: e.g., This feature assumes an `AuthService` is provided via dependency injection.]`

---

## ⚙️ Requirements & Scope

**In Scope:**
* [Requirement 1 for this feature]

**Out of Scope:**
* [Functionality that is explicitly not part of this module]

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
* [ ] Criterion 1: *Description of what must be true for this criterion to pass.*

---

## 🔧 Setup & Integration

### Required Dependencies
* `package_name: ^version`

### Integration Steps
1.  **Dependencies**: Add the packages listed above to your `pubspec.yaml`.
2.  **Configuration**: [e.g., Initialize `FeatureService()` in your main dependency injection container.]
3.  **Routing**: [e.g., Add `FeatureRoutes.routes` to your main app router configuration.]
4.  **Usage**: [e.g., To launch the feature, navigate to `/feature_route`.]

## 💾 Data Model
[Describe data models, or write "No new data models." if not applicable.]

---

## 🐒 API
[Describe API interactions, or write "No direct API interactions." if not applicable.]

---

## 🎨 UI/UX Behaviour
* [UI/UX note 1: e.g., The main view uses a Sliver app bar for a collapsing header effect.]

---

## 📝 Suggested High Level Approach
[Describe the internal architecture and data flow, optionally using a Mermaid diagram.]

<examples>
Directory structure example:
lib/features/{name-of-feature}/
├── /views         # Screen-level components
├── /widgets       # Reusable, self-contained UI components
├── /services      # Business logic, state management, and service orchestration
├── /apis          # Clients and logic for interacting with external APIs
├── /models        # Internal domain data structures
├── /dtos          # Data Transfer Objects for API communication
├── /routing       # Feature-specific navigation logic
├── /constants     # Static, unchanging, or literal values
├── /enums         # Enumeration types
├── /strings       # String literals
└── README.md      # Comprehensive documentation

CRITICAL ANTI-PATTERN example:
// NEVER do this:
Widget _buildHeader() {
  return Container(...);
}

// ALWAYS do this instead:
class _HeaderWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(...);
  }
}
</examples>

<relevant_context>
- Flutter/Dart development environment
- Feature-based architecture for maximum reusability
- Dependency injection pattern assumed for service integration
- The feature module must be self-contained with all imports within the module using relative paths
- Dependencies on code outside the folder limited exclusively to base SDK (Flutter, Dart) and common third-party packages
- Project uses specific naming conventions (e.g., T... for custom widgets)
- Features should be portable and can be copied and pasted from one project to another with minimal integration effort
</relevant_context>

<acceptance_criteria>
- All files for the feature must reside in a single directory: lib/features/{name-of-feature}/
- A comprehensive README.md file must be created at the root of the feature directory following the exact template
- The feature module must be self-contained with relative imports only
- Public-facing widgets and services should expose a clean, intuitive, and robust API
- A file exists at components/widgets/ containing the correct widget implementation
- The central TComponent enum is correctly updated to include the new widget's enum value, category, label, and description
- The widget is visible and rendered correctly in the ComponentsView
- The onComponentPressed method in the ComponentsViewModel is updated to handle interactions with the new component
</acceptance_criteria>

<best_practices>
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Apply everywhere it is sensible
- Separation of Concerns: Maintain clear and strict separation between UI, Business Logic, and Data Logic
- Code Granularity: Keep classes, files, and methods small and focused
- Each public class must have its own file
- Services for Logic: Use Services or similar pattern to isolate and contain business logic
- Stateless by Default: Prefer creating StatelessWidgets for UI and composition
- Only use StatefulWidgets when explicitly necessary for managing transient, internal UI state
- Code should be self-documenting
- Centralize all hardcoded strings, numbers, and other literal values in their respective abstract class {Type}Collection.{var} ... constant files
- Use enums to differentiate between types where appropriate
- Always consider algorithmic complexity (Big O) in implementations
- Be mindful of security measures and implement them where necessary
</best_practices>

<personal_preferences>
- Use snake_case for feature directory names (e.g., user_profile)
- Follow the specific directory structure with /views, /widgets, /services, /apis, /models, /dtos, /routing, /constants, /enums, /strings
- Follow project's existing naming conventions (e.g., T... for public widgets)
- Prefer composition over inheritance for UI components
- Create separate private StatelessWidget classes instead of methods returning widgets
</personal_preferences>

<hard_requirements>
- All files must reside in lib/features/{name-of-feature}/ directory
- Must create comprehensive README.md following the exact template provided
- All imports within the module must use relative paths
- External dependencies limited to base SDK and documented third-party packages
- NEVER use methods that return a Widget for building parts of UI
- Create separate private StatelessWidget classes instead
- Unit Tests Only: Only create isolated unit tests for business logic
- NEVER introduce any new third-party packages unless explicitly requested
- Final code must be production-ready and free of analyzer errors or warnings
</hard_requirements>

<quality_standards>
- Production-ready code with no analyzer errors or warnings
- Code must align with existing project architecture
- Clean, intuitive, and robust API exposure
- Self-documenting code without inline comments inside method bodies
- Comprehensive documentation in README.md
- Proper separation of UI, business logic, and data logic
- Performance-conscious implementations
- Security-aware code where applicable
- Maximum reusability and portability
</quality_standards>

<restrictions>
- NEVER use methods that return a Widget for building parts of a UI
- No inline comments inside method bodies
- NEVER create UI, widget, or integration tests
- NEVER use mocks or any mocking frameworks
- Do not introduce any new third-party packages or dependencies unless explicitly requested
- Do not use absolute imports within the feature module
- Do not create dependencies on code outside the feature folder except for base SDK
</restrictions>
