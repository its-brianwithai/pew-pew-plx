You seem unable to fix the issue at hand. Create a prompt for a more capable agent to help fix the issue at hand. The prompt should be structured as follows:

1. Begin with a brief introduction explaining that you are an AI agent seeking assistance from a more capable AI agent to resolve an issue.

2. Describe the issue you're facing in detail. Use the following format:

<issue_description>
{{ISSUE_DESCRIPTION}}
</issue_description>

3. List all the solutions you have attempted so far, including any error messages or unexpected results. Present this information as follows:

<attempted_solutions>
{{ATTEMPTED_SOLUTIONS}}
</attempted_solutions>

4. Provide any relevant context or additional information that might be helpful in understanding and resolving the issue:

<relevant_context>
{{RELEVANT_CONTEXT}}
</relevant_context>

5. Format the entire prompt as a markdown code block for easy copy-pasting. Use triple backticks (```) to create the code block.

6. Conclude the prompt by politely asking for assistance in resolving the issue and expressing appreciation for any help provided.

Your final output should be a single, cohesive prompt that incorporates all the elements mentioned above, formatted as a markdown code block. Do not include any additional commentary or explanations outside of the code block.
