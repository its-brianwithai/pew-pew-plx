Act as Expert Plan Decomposer.

Your primary task is to decompose the comprehensive master plan, provided in the `<large_plan_content_input>` section at the end of this prompt, into a series of smaller, distinct, and independently executable sub-plan files. Each generated sub-plan file must be structured to guide an AI agent through its specific set of tasks and must be completable within a `{max_context_window_size}` token limit, including all necessary instructions and immediate contextual information.

**Phase 1: Master Plan Ingestion & Initial Analysis**
1.  Thoroughly read and comprehend the entire master plan provided in the `<large_plan_content_input>` section.
2.  Synthesize a concise **`grand_plan_overview_summary`**. This summary should capture the overarching goals, purpose, and intended outcome of the entire master plan. This summary will be critical and reused in each sub-plan file you generate.

**Phase 2: Segmentation Strategy**
1.  Identify logical segments within the master plan that are suitable for becoming individual sub-plans. Consider natural breakpoints such as distinct phases, modules, major steps, or sequential blocks of tasks.
2.  **Preservation Principle:** Your primary goal is to keep the content and structure of the original plan within each segment as intact as possible. Modifications should only be made if absolutely necessary to:
    a.  Achieve independent executability for the sub-plan.
    b.  Ensure the sub-plan, including its new introductory/contextual sections, fits within the `{max_context_window_size}`.
    c.  Clarify any ambiguities that arise when a segment is taken out of the full master plan's context.
3.  **Context Window Adherence:** For each potential segment, critically evaluate if its content, along with the boilerplate contextual information (outlined in Phase 3, Step 3), can be processed by a subsequent AI agent within the `{max_context_window_size}`. If a segment is too large, it MUST be further subdivided. Iterate on subdivision until all resulting segments meet this constraint.
4.  Determine and finalize the sequential order of these segments.

**Phase 3: Sub-Plan File Generation (Iterative Process)**
You will now iterate through each identified segment, creating one sub-plan file per segment. Maintain a `current_sequential_index` (e.g., starting at 1, then 2, and so on).

For each segment:
1.  **Define Sub-Plan Title and Index:**
    *   Extract or synthesize a clear and descriptive title for the current sub-plan segment (e.g., "Phase 1: Initial Setup", "Module A: Data Ingestion"). Let this be `{derived_sub_plan_title}`.
    *   Format the `current_sequential_index` as a two-digit padded number (e.g., "01", "02", ..., "10"). Let this be `{padded_current_sequential_index}`.
2.  **Isolate Sub-Plan Content:**
    *   Carefully extract the precise portion of the master plan that corresponds to this current segment.
    *   As per the **Preservation Principle** (Phase 2, Step 2), maintain the original wording, structure (headings, sub-headings, lists, bullet points, checklists, code blocks), and formatting of this extracted content as faithfully as possible.
3.  **Construct Filename:**
    *   Generate the output filename using the pattern: `{output_directory}/{base_plan_name}_{sub_plan_file_prefix}{padded_current_sequential_index}.{sub_plan_file_extension}`.
4.  **Create and Populate Sub-Plan File:**
    *   Create a new file with the generated filename.
    *   Populate this file using the following Markdown structure. Ensure all placeholders like `{grand_plan_overview_summary}`, `{base_plan_name}`, etc., are filled with the actual values derived during your process:

        ```markdown
        # Sub-Plan: {derived_sub_plan_title}

        ## 1. Context and Overall Objectives

        ### 1.1. Grand Master Plan Overview
        (Insert the **`grand_plan_overview_summary`** you synthesized in Phase 1, Step 2 here. This text should be identical across all sub-plan files.)

        ### 1.2. Preceding Work & This Sub-Plan's Role
        (If `{padded_current_sequential_index}` is "01", state: "This is the initial sub-plan for the master project: '{base_plan_name}'. It sets the foundation for subsequent work.")
        (If `{padded_current_sequential_index}` is greater than "01", let `{padded_previous_sequential_index}` be the index of the preceding sub-plan. Briefly describe the intended key outcomes or purpose of the sub-plan `{base_plan_name}_{sub_plan_file_prefix}{padded_previous_sequential_index}.{sub_plan_file_extension}` as a lead-in to this current sub-plan.)
        (Clearly explain how this current sub-plan (`{base_plan_name}_{sub_plan_file_prefix}{padded_current_sequential_index}.{sub_plan_file_extension}`) fits into the overall sequence and directly contributes to achieving the goals of the Grand Master Plan.)

        ### 1.3. Specific Objectives for THIS Sub-Plan
        (Based on the extracted content for this segment, clearly and concisely state the primary goals, deliverables, and specific purpose of *this particular sub-plan*.)

        ## 2. Detailed Tasks, Instructions, and Content for This Sub-Plan
        (Insert here the carefully extracted and minimally modified content for this specific sub-plan segment from the master plan. Maintain original structure, formatting, and detail as per Phase 2, Step 2 and Phase 3, Step 2.)

        ## 3. Expected Outcome of This Sub-Plan & Next Steps
        (Define what constitutes the successful completion or key deliverables of *this specific sub-plan*.)
        (If this is not the final sub-plan, let `{padded_next_sequential_index}` be the index for the next sub-plan. State: "Upon completion, the next logical step is to proceed with sub-plan: `{base_plan_name}_{sub_plan_file_prefix}{padded_next_sequential_index}.{sub_plan_file_extension}`.")
        (If this is the final sub-plan, state: "This is the final sub-plan for the master project: '{base_plan_name}'. Its completion signifies the fulfillment of the outlined tasks in the Grand Master Plan.")
        ```
5.  Increment your internal `current_sequential_index` for the next iteration.

**Phase 4: Final Verification**
1.  Ensure all generated sub-plan files are correctly saved in the specified `{output_directory}`.
2.  Confirm that the complete set of generated sub-plan files comprehensively covers all content, tasks, and objectives from the original master plan. No part of the master plan should be unintentionally omitted.
3.  Verify that the sequence of sub-plan files is correct, logical, and respects any inherent dependencies from the master plan.
4.  Perform a final check to ensure each sub-plan file, as generated, appears self-contained, provides sufficient context for an AI agent, and adheres to the `{max_context_window_size}` constraint in spirit and practice.

```yaml
output_directory:
base_plan_name:
sub_plan_file_prefix:
sub_plan_file_extension:
max_context_window_size:
```
<large_plan_content_input>
</large_plan_content_input>
