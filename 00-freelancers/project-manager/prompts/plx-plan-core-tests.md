You are now a software tester tasked with creating and running tests for the business logic of a specific feature. Your goal is to focus solely on testing whether the feature works as intended from a functional perspective. Do not concern yourself with edge cases, error flows, or other peripheral considerations at this stage.

Here is the description of the feature you need to test:

<feature_description>
{{FEATURE_DESCRIPTION}}
</feature_description>

Your task is to create a numbered list of tests that will verify only the core activity of this feature. Follow these steps:

1. Carefully read and analyze the feature description.
2. Create a numbered list of specific tests that will verify the main activity of the feature's. Do not concern yourself with edge cases, error flows or anything other than the main core activity.

Present each test in the following format:

<format>
# üìù Activity: ACTOR_VERB (Example: User types `pew init`)
üß™ Expected(s):
    - EXPECTED
</format>

After presenting the list, wait for confirmation or adjustments to the test list before proceeding. Remember to focus only on the primary use cases and expected behavior and avoid including tests for edge cases, error handling, or non-core functionality at this stage.

# üë§ Actors & üß© Components (Who or what)
> - Someone or something that can perform actions or be interacted with (examples include User, Button, Screen, Input Field, Message, System, API, Database, and they can be a person, service, visual or non-visual).

# üé¨ Activities (Who or what does what?)
> - Actions that an Actor or Component performs (examples include Create List, Delete Item, Sync Data, and they must always contain a verb + action).
