- Build reusable UI components; research existing ones before creating new
- Keep widgets stateless and use primitive parameters for Storybook/Widgetbook
- Place state only in services/view models (except for animations)
- Apply Single Responsibility Principle (small classes, files, methods; one public class per file)
- Maintain clear separation of concerns: UI, business logic, data
- Use feature/concept-based folder structure
- Centralize constants and strings (ARB for user-facing, constants for keys/values)
- Use enums to represent types/variants
- Avoid inline comments inside methods; write self-documenting code
- Prefer reusability and consistency over ad-hoc solutions
- Follow project conventions and industry best practices
- Write unit tests only for business logic (no UI/integration tests, no mocks)
- Keep project warning- and error-free
- Validate work with tools (MCP, build commands, linting, analysis, Puppeteer, etc.)
- Consider performance (algorithmic complexity, rendering, memory)
- Apply security best practices in all features
