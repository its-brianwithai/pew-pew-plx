I've added some {feedback_identifier} as feedback.
- Use grep to find them all and process them.
- After processing the feedback, scan the {instructions_folders} for any relevant files that may be missing or need updating regarding the files you just updated.
- Create and/or update them with these project conventions based on the feedback you received to avoid making the same mistakes next time.

instructions_folders: {argument name="instructions_folders"}
