<relevant_context>
This is a prototype workflow for comprehensively documenting all aspects of an application through JSON context prompts. The workflow involves systematic identification and documentation of design systems, UI components, data models, routes, services, network requests, user stories, features, and infrastructure configurations. Each element requires both an overview prompt and individual detailed prompts for complete coverage. The JSONs created are never committed to version control and can include sensitive data. Each JSON structure must be uniquely optimized for its category and the specific project requirements.
