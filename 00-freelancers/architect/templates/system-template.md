# ⚙️ System: {title}

> Comprehensive system specification documenting workflows, technical requirements, and implementation steps for {system_name}. Defines goals, rules, scope, and detailed activity flows to create a repeatable, maintainable process that can be executed by both humans and AI agents.

## 🔖 Description
> 💡 *A brief description of the system and (optional) instructions on how to get started.*

<!-- Describe the system's purpose and provide any initial guidance for users. -->

## 🤖 AI Agent Context
> 💡 *Essential information for the AI agent to understand and execute tasks related to this system. Review all linked resources thoroughly before proceeding.*

### 📚 Relevant Project Files & Code
> 💡 *List all project files, code snippets, or directories that the AI agent **must read and understand** to effectively utilize or modify this system. Include paths relative to the project root and a brief note on their relevance.*
*   `[path/to/related_script.sh]` - (Relevance: Core script that this system orchestrates)
*   `[path/to/configuration_file.yaml]` - (Relevance: Configuration parameters for the system)
*   *Example: `docs/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` - (Relevance: Overall architecture this system fits into)*

### 🌐 Relevant Documentation & Links
> 💡 *List any external web pages, API documentation, design specifications, or other online resources the AI agent should consult when working with this system.*
*   `[Link to tool/platform documentation used by the system]` - (Relevance: e.g., GitHub Actions docs)
*   `[Link to conceptual overview of the process this system automates]` - (Relevance: Understanding the "why")
*   *Example: `https://example.com/api/v1/status` - (Relevance: API endpoint the system interacts with)*

### 💡 Other Key Information
> 💡 *Include any other critical context, specific instructions, or points the AI agent needs to be aware of. This could include previous decisions, specific constraints, or key operational considerations.*
*   `[Context point 1: e.g., This system is designed to be idempotent.]`
*   `[Context point 2: e.g., Ensure all outputs are logged to the standard logging directory.]`
*   *Example: The system should be run during off-peak hours to minimize impact.*

## 🎯 Goals
> 💡 *Clear definition(s) of what this system aims to accomplish. What are the desired outcomes?*

- <!-- Goal 1: e.g., To streamline the process of X. -->
- <!-- Goal 2: e.g., To ensure consistency in Y. -->
- <!-- Add more goals as needed -->

## 📏 Rules
> 💡 *Guidelines, constraints, and principles to follow when creating, using, or modifying this system.*

- <!-- Rule 1: e.g., Treat each new system iteration as an MVP. -->
- <!-- Rule 2: e.g., Improve only one aspect at a time. -->
- <!-- Add more rules as needed -->

## 🔭 Scope
> 💡 *Define the boundaries of this system. What is included, and what is explicitly excluded?*

**In Scope:**
- <!-- e.g., Creating and maintaining system documentation. -->
- <!-- Add more in-scope items -->

**Out of Scope:**
- <!-- e.g., Hosting or deployment of the system itself. -->
- <!-- Add more out-of-scope items -->

## 🪜 Steps
> 💡 *The heart of every system. All activities, procedures, and results in chronological order.*

### 📋 Pre-requisites
> 💡 *What needs to be in place or understood before starting the steps? (e.g., tools, access, knowledge)*

- [ ] <!-- Prerequisite 1: e.g., Access to the XYZ tool. -->
- [ ] <!-- Prerequisite 2: e.g., Understanding of ABC concept. -->
- <!-- Add more pre-requisites as needed -->

### 👣 Activity Flow
> 💡 *Detail each step involved in executing this system from start to finish.*

1.  **Step 1: [Action Verb + Task]**
    - <!-- Description or sub-steps for Step 1 -->
    - <!-- Expected result of Step 1 -->
2.  **Step 2: [Action Verb + Task]**
    - <!-- Description or sub-steps for Step 2 -->
    - <!-- Expected result of Step 2 -->
- <!-- Add more steps as needed, following the same format -->

## 💡 Insights
> 💡 *Observations, lessons learned, and ideas for improvement gathered while developing or using the system.*

- <!-- Insight 1: e.g., Noticed that Step X is often a bottleneck. -->
- <!-- Insight 2: e.g., Users frequently ask about Y, consider adding it to the description. -->
- <!-- Add more insights as they arise -->

## 🎙️ Final Remarks
> 💡 *Anything else worth mentioning that hasn't been covered? (e.g., disclaimers, acknowledgements, tips)*

<!-- Add any concluding thoughts, important notes, or disclaimers here. -->

## 🐒 Example / Result
