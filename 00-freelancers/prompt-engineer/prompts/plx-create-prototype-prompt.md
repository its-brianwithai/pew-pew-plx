I would like to prototype {feature_description} in apps like {prototype_apps} first before we start implementing {feature_description} in this project. Please provide a clear, effective, and concise starting prompt optimized specifically for quickly prototyping this feature in apps like {prototype_apps} with the goal of providing all relevant context needed to prototype it in their app and then exporting the result as initial input for the actual implementation in this app.

```yaml
prototype_apps: Bolt.new, v0, Lovable
feature_description: 
```
