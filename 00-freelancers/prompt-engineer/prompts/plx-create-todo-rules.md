I've added some `TODO(CREATE-RULE)` as feedback in the project. Use your grep tool (or `grep -r "TODO(CREATE-RULE)" .` in root) to find them all.

Ask clarifying questions needed until you reach 100% certainty about the exact content of each rule based on the todo, project conventions and my instructions.
Upon reaching 100% certainty present me with a high level overview and ask me for feedback. Process the feedback and ask for feedback again until I confirm.
Upon confirmation from me that there is no more feedback you may proceed create the rules.
