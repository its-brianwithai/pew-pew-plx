## ⏱️ 3. Effort Breakdown & Estimates
> 💡 *Break down the estimated effort for this specific user story.*

*   **Design:** `[X]` hours
    *   _Reasoning: `[Explain why this amount of design effort is needed, or 0 if none. e.g., Wireframes needed, UI adjustments, No design effort required as it follows existing patterns.]`_
*   **Refinement:** `[X]` hours
    *   _Reasoning: `[Explain the effort needed for planning, detailing requirements, and refining the approach for this user story. e.g., Clarifying acceptance criteria, API contract discussion.]`_
*   **Front-end:** `[X]` hours
    *   _Reasoning: `[Explain the front-end development tasks involved (UI implementation, state management, API integration, etc.). e.g., Implementing new widget, Connecting to X endpoint.]`_
*   **Backend:** `[X]` hours
    *   _Reasoning: `[Explain the backend development tasks involved (API endpoints, database changes, logic, etc.). e.g., Creating new Y function, Modifying Z table schema.]`_
*   **General Work:** `[X]` hours
    *   _Reasoning: `[Explain any other tasks not covered above (e.g., documentation, specific integrations, meetings related to this story). e.g., Updating API documentation.]`_


## 🧪 4. QA, Testing & Delay Margin
> 💡 *Estimates for quality assurance, testing efforts, and buffer time for potential delays for this specific user story.*

*   **QA:** `[X]` hours (`[Y]`%)
    *   _Reasoning: `[Based on complexity, explain the QA effort needed (manual testing, exploratory testing). e.g., Testing happy path and edge cases for feature X.]`_
*   **Testing (Automated):** `[X]` hours (`[Y]`%)
    *   _Reasoning: `[Based on complexity, explain the testing effort needed (unit tests, integration tests, e2e tests). e.g., Writing unit tests for new service, Adding integration test for Y component.]`_
*   **Delay Margin:** `[X]` hours (`[Y]`%)
    *   _Reasoning: `[Based on complexity and potential risks/unknowns, explain the buffer needed. e.g., Potential for unforeseen issues with third-party API.]`_


## 📊 5. Total Estimated Effort
> 💡 *Sum of all estimated hours for this user story.*

*   **Total Effort:** `[Sum of all estimates above]` hours


## 📦 6. Deliverables / Artifacts
> 💡 *List the tangible outputs or artifacts that will be produced upon completion of this user story.*

*   `[Deliverable 1: e.g., New UI component for X in Storybook/Figma]`
*   `[Deliverable 2: e.g., API endpoint documentation for Y]`
*   `[Deliverable 3: e.g., Updated user guide section for Z]`
*   `[Deliverable 4: e.g., Set of passing automated tests covering new logic]`
*   `[Deliverable 5: e.g., Merged Pull Request with implemented feature]`


## ✅ 7. Acceptance Criteria
> 💡 *Define the specific, measurable criteria that must be met for this user story to be considered complete and accepted. Each should be a testable statement.*

*   [ ] Criterion 1: `[e.g., User can successfully perform X action via the new UI on Y screen.]`
*   [ ] Criterion 2: `[e.g., Backend endpoint Z returns the expected data structure and status code 200 upon successful request.]`
*   [ ] Criterion 3: `[e.g., All related unit tests for service A pass successfully.]`
*   [ ] Criterion 4: `[e.g., The feature meets the design specifications outlined in [Link to Figma/Design Document].]`
*   [ ] Criterion 5: `[e.g., Error state B is handled gracefully and displays message C.]`


## 📝 8. Assumptions & Notes
> 💡 *List any assumptions made during the estimation process. Include any important notes, exclusions, dependencies, or potential risks related to this specific user story.*

*   **Assumptions:**
    *   `[Assumption 1: e.g., Availability of specific APIs (e.g., API X is stable and returns expected data).]`
    *   `[Assumption 2: e.g., Existing infrastructure (e.g., Database schema for Y is in place).]`
    *   `[Assumption 3: e.g., Design specifications are final and will not significantly change.]`
*   **Notes/Exclusions:**
    *   `[Note 1: e.g., This story does not cover administrative interface for X.]`
    *   `[Note 2: e.g., Performance testing beyond standard checks is out of scope for this story.]`
*   **Dependencies:**
    *   `[Dependency 1: e.g., Requires completion of User Story #ABC (Link to story).]`
    *   `[Dependency 2: e.g., Relies on updated design system components.]`
