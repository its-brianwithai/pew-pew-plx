# 📄 PRD: {title}

> Comprehensive Product Requirements Document for {product/feature} defining strategic objectives, user personas, functional/non-functional requirements, backend specifications, and release criteria. Serves as the authoritative source for product development and stakeholder alignment.

## 📄 Product Requirements Document (PRD)
> 💡 *Tailored for Flutter & Firebase/Supabase Projects*

## 🎯 I. Introduction & Purpose

### A. Document Overview
> 💡 *This section provides a general overview of what a PRD is and its role, especially for Flutter & Firebase/Supabase projects. This text is generally static.*
This document provides a template for creating Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) specifically tailored for software projects utilizing the Flutter framework with either Firebase or Supabase as the backend service. A PRD serves as a central artifact defining the product or feature to be built, outlining its purpose, features, functionalities, and behavior. It acts as a crucial communication bridge between the initial project concept and the detailed engineering implementation plan, ensuring alignment among stakeholders including product managers, designers, developers, testers, and marketing teams.

This template is designed to be flexible, catering to both broad, project-scoped PRDs that define an entire new product or release, and more specific, feature-scoped PRDs that detail a single piece of functionality within a larger product. The goal is to provide "just enough" context and detail to guide development effectively within an agile environment, fostering collaboration and clarity without becoming overly burdensome or static.

### B. Purpose of *This Specific* PRD
> 💡 *Clearly state whether this PRD covers an entire project/release or a specific feature. Define the high-level objective of what is being documented.*
>
> **Example (Project Scope):** "This PRD outlines the requirements for the initial release (MVP) of the 'ConnectSphere' mobile application, a social networking platform built using Flutter and Firebase, focusing on core user profile creation, connection requests, and a basic activity feed."
>
> **Example (Feature Scope):** "This PRD details the requirements for implementing the 'Real-time Chat' feature within the existing 'TaskMaster' Flutter/Supabase application, enabling users to communicate directly within project workspaces."

## ⭐ XIII. Conclusion and Recommendations
> 💡 *This section provides a general conclusion for PRDs of this type. This text is generally static.*
This PRD template provides a structured framework for defining requirements for Flutter applications utilizing Firebase or Supabase backends. Its core purpose is to foster clarity, alignment, and collaboration among all project stakeholders. By systematically addressing goals, scope, user needs, functional and non-functional requirements (including platform-specific considerations like accessibility and backend security), design integration, and release criteria, teams can mitigate risks associated with ambiguity and scope creep.

**Key Recommendations for Use:**
1.  **Adaptability:** Tailor this template to the specific needs of the project.
2.  **Collaboration:** Treat the PRD as a collaborative artifact.
3.  **Living Document:** Maintain the PRD throughout the development lifecycle.
4.  **Platform Specificity:** Pay close attention to NFRs and Backend Specifications.
5.  **Focus on the 'Why':** Consistently link features back to user personas and goals.

By utilizing this template thoughtfully and collaboratively, teams can establish a shared understanding, make informed decisions, and ultimately build higher-quality Flutter applications that effectively meet user needs and business objectives.
