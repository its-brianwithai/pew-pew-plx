{user_request}: Create a comprehensive, prioritized product backlog with clearly defined epics and user stories that follow a logical implementation sequence. Each story should be granular, actionable, and include detailed acceptance criteria that junior developers can implement incrementally. Ensure complete coverage of all requirements in the PRD, including technical setup tasks, data models, UI components, and integration points. Structure the backlog to support step-by-step development that builds functionality progressively while maintaining alignment with the architectural decisions documented in the architecture document.
