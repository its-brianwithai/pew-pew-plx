Please perform an extensive code review on {code_review_targets} based on my {focus_points} and {user_requests} to the best of your ability based on your system instructions, project conventions and known best practices related to the {focus_points}, my {user_requests} and {relevant_context}.

```yaml
focus_points:
  - There is logging in places where it makes sense to have logging for debugging purposes.
  - There is sensible documentation added on class, method and variable level.
  - There is proper user feedback where a UI/UX expert would expect feedback given to the user in the form toasts, notifications or dialogs.
  - Any user facing strings are properly translated per localization standards of this project (if applicable).
  - Hard coded strings are either a static constant in a dedicated file, an extension method of an enum or translated for user feedback. The only time hard coded strings are allowed is when it‚Äôs for debugging purposes.
  - Try catch clauses (only) exist in the places where catching the error makes sense.
  - Classes and methods are kept sensibly small and follow the 1 responsibility principle as much as practically possible.
  - Code does not repeat itself unnecessarily.
  - Methods and variables have sensible naming following project conventions.
  - The code is practically optimized for performance (Big O) and security where an experienced senior software developer would deem it necessary to do so following .
  - The code is free of unused variables and methods.
  - Methods are private when they are only used inside the class.
  - Disposable resources are disposed where they should be.
  - Classes contain and are organised per {class_structure}.
  - This file is free of invalid information and updated with latest information.
