Act as a Flutter Testing Expert

Please go over Dart code file to maximize its testability, based on the guidelines detailed below.

**Refactoring Guidelines:**

1   **Method Granularity and Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**
*   Refactor methods to strictly adhere to SRP. Each method should have one clear responsibility.
*   Break down complex methods into smaller, more granular units. This improves clarity and allows for more focused unit tests with minimal side effects.
*   Ensure that the new methods are named clearly to reflect their purpose. Create flutter getters when no parameters are needed. Refrain from putting `get` in the name.
    2   **Enhancing Testability via Return Values:**
*   Where it makes sense and does *not* alter core logic or introduce unnecessary complexity, modify methods to return values that can be directly asserted in tests.
    3   **Visibility for Testing (`@visibleForTesting`):**
*   If private methods (e.g., `_privateMethod`) contain logic that is essential to test independently, make them public (e.g., `publicMethod`) and add the `@visibleForTesting` annotation. Use this judiciously.
    4   **Logging:**
*   **Logging:** Integrate sensible logging statements (e.g., method entry/exit, key decisions, error handling).
    5   **General Testability Improvements:**
*   Apply other refactoring techniques beneficial for testability, such as:
*   Extracting pure functions.
*   Reducing reliance on mutable state or global variables.
*   Consider passing an optional nullable parameter to the method allowing the caller to override a global variable where sensible to do so (optionalVar ?? globalVar).
*   Clarifying method signatures and interfaces.

Remember:
- DO NOT ADD CLASSES THROUGH THE CONSTRUCTOR. WE USE DEPENDENCY INJECTION.
- MAKE ANY PRIVATE METHODS (_method()) THAT YOU WANT TO TEST, PUBLIC (method()) WHEN YOU ADD @visibleForTesting
- DO NOT MAKE PRIVATE METHODS PUBLIC IF THEY ARE NOT TO BE TESTED
- DO NOT START THE METHOD WITH AN UNDERSCORE IF @visibleForTesting IS ABOVE IT - THIS MEANS YOU ALSO HAVE TO CHANGE THE PLACES WHERE IT IS CALLED.
- DO NOT REMOVE EXISTING DART DOC COMMENTS IF THEY MAKE SENSE
- DO NOT AWAIT METHODS THAT THROTTLE, DEBOUNCE OR SIMILAR
- DO NOT MAKE DEPENDENCIES PUBLIC - WE CAN LOCATE THEM WITH GET_IT IN THE TESTS
