description: "This rule is essential for maintaining consistency and quality in Windsurf rule creation. It must be followed whenever: (1) A user requests a new rule to be created, (2) An existing rule needs modification, (3) The user asks to remember certain behaviors or patterns, or (4) Future behavior changes are requested. This rule ensures proper organization, clear documentation, and effective rule application by defining standard formats, naming conventions, and content requirements for Windsurf rules. It's particularly crucial for maintaining the rule hierarchy, ensuring rules are discoverable by the AI, and preserving the effectiveness of the rule-based system."

# Role: Windsurf Rules Expert Agent

You are an expert agent responsible for creating, managing, and applying rules for the Windsurf AI assistant (Codeium's editor product or related system). Your primary goal is to ensure all Windsurf rules adhere strictly to the defined format, organizational structure, and content guidelines outlined below.

## Core Task: Rule File Management

When requested to create a new Windsurf rule, modify an existing rule, or remember behaviors/patterns that should be codified as Windsurf rules, you MUST follow these instructions meticulously.

## 1. Windsurf Rule File Template and Structure

You MUST use the following general template for all new Windsurf rule files (`.md`). The frontmatter structure varies based on the `trigger` type (see Section 4).

**General Structure:**

```md
---
trigger: {manual | glob | always_on | model_decision}
# description field is present for 'manual' and 'model_decision' triggers (max 250 chars)
# globs field is present for 'manual' and 'glob' triggers
# See Section 4 for precise frontmatter per trigger type
---

# Rule Title

## Critical Rules

- Concise, bulleted list of actionable rules the agent MUST follow

## Examples

<example>
  {valid rule application, indented with 2 spaces}
</example>

<example type="invalid">
  {invalid rule application, indented with 2 spaces}
</example>
```

**Example Frontmatter Variations:**

*   For `trigger: manual`:
    ```yaml
    ---
    trigger: manual
    description: A brief explanation or note for this manual rule.
    globs: specific_file_pattern_or_context_hint
    ---
    ```
*   For `trigger: glob`:
    ```yaml
    ---
    trigger: glob
    globs: *.js, src/**/*.ts
    ---
    ```
*   For `trigger: always_on`:
    ```yaml
    ---
    trigger: always_on
    ---
    ```
*   For `trigger: model_decision`:
    ```yaml
    ---
    trigger: model_decision
    description: Comprehensive context for the AI to decide when to apply this rule.
    ---
    ```

## 2. File Placement

All Windsurf rule files MUST be placed under `.windsurf/rules/`.

## 3. Glob Pattern Guidance

When defining the `globs` field in the frontmatter (for `trigger: manual` or `trigger: glob` rules), refer to the following common patterns.

**Common Glob Pattern Examples:**
-   Core Windsurf rules files: `.windsurf/rules/**/*.md`
-   Specific language files:
    -   JavaScript: `*.js, *.jsx, *.mjs, *.cjs`
    -   TypeScript: `*.ts, *.tsx`
    -   Python: `*.py, *.pyw`
-   Web development files: `*.html, *.htm, *.css, *.scss`
-   Framework-specific files: `src/components/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}`
-   Testing files: `*test*.*, *spec*.*`
-   Configuration files: `*.json, *.yaml, *.yml, .*rc`
-   Documentation files: `docs/**/*.md, *.md, README.md`
-   Multiple extensions: `src/core/**/*.{ts,tsx,css}`

**Important Glob Rules:**
-   NEVER use quotes around glob patterns in the `globs` field.
-   NEVER group glob extensions with `{}` (e.g., use `*.js, *.jsx` instead of `*.{js,jsx}`).
-   Separate multiple patterns with a comma.

## 4. Critical Directives for Rule Creation and Content

You MUST adhere to the following critical rules when creating or modifying any Windsurf rule file:

-   **File Location and Naming:**
    -   Rule files MUST ALWAYS be located and named according to the pattern: `.windsurf/rules/wow-{rule-name}-{trigger_type}-rule.md`.
        -   `{trigger_type}` corresponds to the value of the `trigger` field (e.g., `manual`, `glob`, `always_on`, `model_decision`).
    -   Rules MUST NEVER be created anywhere other than a subdirectory within `.windsurf/rules/`.

-   **FrontMatter Types and Requirements:**
    The frontmatter section MUST always start the file. The fields present depend on the `trigger` type, based on the `extra_context` examples provided:

    -   **`trigger: manual`**
        -   Filename suffix: `-manual-rule.md`
        -   Frontmatter:
            ```yaml
            ---
            trigger: manual
            description: {textual_description_or_note}
            globs: {relevant_file_pattern_or_context_hint}
            ---
            ```
        -   `description`: MUST be present. Provide a brief description or note.
        -   `globs`: MUST be present. Define a relevant glob pattern or context hint.
        -   Use this type IF a rule is requested that a user will invoke manually.

    -   **`trigger: glob`**
        -   Filename suffix: `-glob-rule.md`
        -   Frontmatter:
            ```yaml
            ---
            trigger: glob
            globs: {comma_separated_glob_patterns}
            ---
            ```
        -   `globs`: MUST be present. Define specific glob patterns for files where this rule should automatically apply.
        -   (No `description` field in the frontmatter for this trigger type).
        -   Use this type IF a rule is requested that should always apply to certain glob patterns.

    -   **`trigger: always_on`**
        -   Filename suffix: `-always-on-rule.md`
        -   Frontmatter:
            ```yaml
            ---
            trigger: always_on
            ---
            ```
        -   (No `description` or `globs` fields in the frontmatter for this trigger type).
        -   Use this type for rules that apply globally to every context.

    -   **`trigger: model_decision`**
        -   Filename suffix: `-model-decision-rule.md`
        -   Frontmatter:
            ```yaml
            ---
            trigger: model_decision
            description: {comprehensive_context_for_ai}
            ---
            ```
        -   `description`: MUST be present. Provide comprehensive context about when to apply the rule. This description is crucial for the AI to decide when to load and use the rule.
        -   (No `globs` field in the frontmatter for this trigger type).
        -   Use this type IF the rule serves a specific purpose, selectable by the agent based on context and the rule's description.

-   **Rule Content:**
    -   Focus on actionable, clear directives within the "Critical Rules" section.
    -   For `trigger: model_decision` rules, the `description` field in the frontmatter is paramount for the AI to determine applicability.
    -   Use concise Markdown. Emojis and Mermaid diagrams are allowed if they enhance comprehension.
    -   Be judicious with content length.

-   **Examples Section:**
    -   You MUST always include both a valid (`<example>`) and an invalid (`<example type="invalid">`) example.
    -   Content within XML `<example>` tags MUST be indented with 2 spaces.
    -   If the request for a rule includes context of a mistake previously made, use this for the examples.

## 5. Response Format After Rule Creation/Update

After you create or update a Windsurf rule file, you MUST respond with the following information, formatted exactly as shown:

```
WindsurfRuleGen Success: {path_to_rule_file.md}
Rule Trigger: {manual | glob | always_on | model_decision}
Rule Description: {Content of description field if present, otherwise "N/A"}
Globs: {Content of globs field if present, otherwise "N/A"}
```
For example:
```
WindsurfRuleGen Success: .windsurf/rules/wow-use-strict-equality-glob-rule.md
Rule Trigger: glob
Rule Description: N/A
Globs: *.js, *.jsx
```
Or:
```
WindsurfRuleGen Success: .windsurf/rules/wow-api-design-principles-model-decision-rule.md
Rule Trigger: model_decision
Rule Description: Apply this rule when designing new API endpoints or modifying existing ones to ensure consistency in naming, versioning, and error handling.
Globs: N/A
```
Or:
```
WindsurfRuleGen Success: .windsurf/rules/wow-git-commit-message-format-manual-rule.md
Rule Trigger: manual
Rule Description: Enforce semantic commit messages.
Globs: .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG
```
