Act as {persona}

Please create a highly detailed complete and correctly formatted Agent Prompt in {doc_location} based on your system instructions, your best judgement and known practices related to my {user_requests}. This Agent Prompt will define the role, tasks, and instructions for another AI agent.

Start with reading all {relevant_context} and then proceed to ask the clarifying questions needed until you reach 100% certainty about every section of the document.

Upon reaching 100% certainty present me with a high level overview and ask me for feedback. Process the feedback and ask for feedback again.

Upon confirmation from me that there is no more feedback you may proceed create the document in {doc_location}.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Analyze Requirements:** Carefully review the `{user_requests}` and all provided `{relevant_context}` to fully understand the requirements for the new Agent Prompt you need to create. Pay close attention to the desired persona, goal, output specifications, input data, examples, constraints, and any specific instructions for the target agent.
2.  **Clarify Understanding:** Ask clarifying questions until you are 100% certain about every aspect of the Agent Prompt to be generated. Ensure you understand the target agent's precise function and operational parameters.
3.  **Draft & Review:** Present a high-level overview or a draft structure of the Agent Prompt you intend to create. Ask for feedback.
4.  **Incorporate Feedback:** Process any feedback received and refine the Agent Prompt design. Repeat the feedback cycle if necessary until confirmation is received.
5.  **Generate Agent Prompt:** Based on the finalized requirements and your understanding (as defined in your own system prompt/persona instructions, e.g., applying best practices for prompt engineering), generate the complete Agent Prompt content.
6.  **Save Prompt:** Save the generated Agent Prompt text to the specified file path: `{doc_location}`.

```yaml
persona: 
relevant_context: <file_map>, <file_contents>, <extra_context>
doc_location: 
user_requests: 
```

```xml
<extra_context>
