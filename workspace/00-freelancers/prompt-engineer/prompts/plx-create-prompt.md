## 1. Precise Goal

*   **What is the exact, unambiguous task the final prompt should instruct the AI model to perform?**
    *   *(e.g., Summarize the key financial results from the provided text, extract company names and associated product names, generate Python code to parse a CSV file, classify customer feedback into 'Positive', 'Negative', or 'Neutral', write a marketing description for a specific product, answer detailed questions based only on the provided document).*

## 2. Output Specifications

*   **Format:**
    *   **What is the required structure and format of the final AI output?**
        *   *(e.g., Bulleted list, JSON object conforming to a specific schema {provide schema below}, exactly 3 paragraphs, numbered steps, a runnable code block in Python, a single classification label).*
        *   **Your Answer:**
    *   **(If JSON Schema):**
        ```json
        ```
*   **Length:**
    *   **What is the desired length, specified precisely?**
        *   *(e.g., "exactly 5 bullet points", "between 50 and 75 words", "a concise single sentence", "no more than 200 tokens").*
        *   **Your Answer:**
*   **Style & Tone:**
    *   **What is the necessary style and tone for the output?**
        *   *(e.g., Formal academic, empathetic customer service agent, witty and informal, objective and factual, technical documentation).*
        *   **Your Answer:**

## 3. Input Data Description

*   **Describe the input data the final prompt will process.**
    *   *(e.g., A long news article, a customer email, a technical specification document, a snippet of source code).*
    *   **Your Answer:**
*   **Suggest a clear placeholder for the input data in the prompt.**
    *   *(e.g., `"""{document_text}"""`, `### Input Text: {customer_review} ###`, `{code_snippet}`).*
    *   **Your Answer:**

## 5. Essential Instructions & Constraints

*   **List critical instructions. Frame these positively (what the AI *should* do) rather than negatively (what it *should not* do).**
    *   *(e.g., "Ensure the summary focuses exclusively on the environmental impact findings", "Generate code that includes error handling for file not found", "The response must begin with a direct answer to the question", "Refer the user to www.samplewebsite.com/help instead of asking for PII").*
    *   **Your Instructions:**
        *   -
        *   -
        *   -

## 6. Persona/Role (If Applicable)

*   **Does the AI need to adopt a specific persona or role? If so, define it clearly.**
    *   *(e.g., "Act as a senior software architect reviewing code", "You are a helpful librarian assisting with research", "No specific persona needed").*
    *   **Your Answer:**
