Based on the work that you have done, please add a new changelog entry to the following files:

<locations>
{{LOCATIONS}}
</locations>

## Guidelines
1. Scan all current files to get a sense of the current structure and content.
2. Add the new entry at the TOP of each markdown / text file, below the main heading
3. Maintain the existing format with date, headings, and bullet points
4. Update JSON / YAML files by replacing the proper fields for all languages

## New Entry Format
For each markdown / text file:
- Include the date ({date}) in the format: "### Month Day, Year". If the date is unclear from this message, ask the user what date it is or use tools to get the right date.
- Include the current version in the date header
- Group changes by category with headings using and emoji icons
- List specific changes as bullet points under each category
- Preserve existing markdown structure

For JSON or YAML files:
- Keep the same structure with language entries
- Update the proper fields for all languages
- Preserve newlines and formatting in the text content
- Ensure the JSON / YAML remains valid

## Example
When adding a new feature like "Dark Mode", you would:
1. Add it under an appropriate category (e.g., "#### ðŸŒŸ General Improvements")
2. Add corresponding bullet points in relevant languages
3. Update all relevant files

## IMPORTANT
- Do not remove any existing content
- Maintain consistent emoji usage
- Ensure proper formatting based on instructions, examples and current content
