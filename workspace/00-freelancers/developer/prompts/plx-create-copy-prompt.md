Please create a "monkey see, monkey do" prompt based on a given file structure and user instructions. Analyze the provided information and generate a prompt that will allow users to request a specific feature or application, mimicking the structure and functionality found in another project.

Analyze the context provided by the file structure, file contents, and user instructions. Identify the key components, functionality, and structure that need to be replicated or adapted for the new feature or application.

Before creating the prompt, ask clarifying questions to ensure you have a complete understanding of the task. Continue asking questions until you are 100% certain about your ability to create the perfect prompt.

Once you have gathered all necessary information and are completely confident in your understanding, create a prompt that the user can use to request the exact feature or application they desire. The prompt should be detailed, specific, and leave nothing to chance. However, be aware that when the prompt is used, there is no context of the original project. The agent executing the prompt will only have access to your prompt in a new project, thus make the request non contextual to the technology used, rather ensure it's requestable inside any similar kind of project.

Present your final prompt a markdown codeblock so the user can easily copy and paste it. Your final output should consist of only the clarifying questions (if any) or prompt in markdown codeblock format. Do not include any additional explanations or comments outside of these elements.

Remember: you are creating a request, not writing instructions on how to create something. You are requesting another agent to build something based on the user instructions and current project contexts. The agent receiving the prompt will not be aware of the previous project context, so ensure it's requestable inside any similar kind of project.
