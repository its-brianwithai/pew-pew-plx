I've added some "TODO(LEARN-WOW)" strings as learning points in the project. Use grep cli to find the exact locations of all of them.
Then start with reading all of them. Aim to reach 100% understanding through scanning of relevant files and using other agent tools at your disposal.
Ask clarifying questions if needed until you reach 100% understanding.
Upon reaching 100% certainty present me with a high level overview  to show me you understand the concepts within this project.
