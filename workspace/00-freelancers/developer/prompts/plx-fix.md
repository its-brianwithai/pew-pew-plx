When {event} occurs we expect {expected_behaviour}, but currently we see {unexpected_behaviour}. Please investigate.

Start by making sure you reach 100% clarity and confidence about the perfect way to fix this in this project following its way of working and best practices. When you are not 100% sure in either of these, then research the project and optionally use your more advanced available agent tools to increase your percentage.

Feel free to ask me all the questions needed after doing initial research to reach 100% clarity and confidence. Be sure to number your questions so I can efficiently reply to them.

Tip: Use multiple sub agents in parallel to investigate the cause faster and more efficiently.
