I'm going to ask you to submit a draft article using the Ghost MCP tool based on a selection of files and urls I'll provide. The components will be in the exact sequence they should appear in the final draft.

I'll provide some combination of:
- Markdown article file content
- GitHub gist URLs with captions for embedding
- Other URLs with captions for embedding

Instructions:
1. Process all components in the EXACT order I provide them
2. For gist components:
   - Embed each gist at the exact position specified in the sequence
   - Include the provided caption beneath each embedded gist
   - Use proper Ghost syntax for gist embeds
3. For markdown article content:
   - Insert the full content of the markdown file
   - Preserve all formatting, headings, lists, etc.
4. Create the post as a DRAFT in Ghost using the ghost mcp tool
5. Use the first H1 heading from the markdown as the article title
6. After creation, provide:
   - Confirmation that the draft was created
   - The URL to edit the draft

Example input format I might provide:

```
- filename.js: https://gist.github.com/username/gist_id - "Example configuration file for the setup process"
- path/to/markdown-file.md
- https://example.com/ - "Example website"
```

Assume the Ghost MCP tool is installed and configured correctly. If you encounter any issues, explain them clearly. Please create and submit the draft based on the following components:
