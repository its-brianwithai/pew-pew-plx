| ID | Category | Reference | Description of Issue | Reasoning / Impact | Suggested Solution | Priority | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `FB-001` | **Bug** | `AC-FUNC-02` | The error message for incorrect password is "An error occurred" instead of the specified "Invalid credentials". | Fails acceptance criteria and provides a poor user experience. | Update the error message string in `path/to/login_view_model.js` to match the AC. | **High** | `Open` |
| `FB-002` | **Suggestion** | `QS-UI-01` | The loading spinner on the login button is slightly off-center. | Does not meet the "pixel-perfect" quality standard and looks unprofessional. | Adjust the CSS padding for the spinner element within the button component. | **Medium** | `Open` |
| `FB-003` | **Question** | `Result Report` | The report mentions using 'form-validator' library, which was not in the original plan. Was this approved? | Introduces a new dependency that needs to be tracked and maintained. | Please add the approval for this library to the "Decisions & Trade-offs" section of the result report. | **Low** | `Open` |
| `FB-004` | **Compliance** | `RULE-01` | The "Terms of Service" link is missing from the sign-up page. | Violates the mandatory legal rule for user registration. | Add a checkbox and link to the Terms of Service on the sign-up form. | **High** | `Open` |
