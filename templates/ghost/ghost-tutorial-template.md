# 🎓 [Tutorial Title]
> 💡 *What you'll learn and why it matters - straight to the point.*

[One sentence hook: what problem this solves. One sentence outcome: what you'll be able to do after. Keep target audience and end goal in mind - no fluff - neutral documentation / tutorial writing style.]

**Time:** [X] minutes

## 📋 Prerequisites
> 💡 *Only the absolute essentials - most tutorials should need nothing.*

[List any truly essential requirements or delete section entirely. Keep target audience and end goal in mind - no fluff - neutral documentation / tutorial writing style.]

```
<example>
- [Tool installations, API keys, file preparations, account setups, or environment configurations]
</example>
```

## 🧠 Theory
> 💡 *How it works under the hood.*

[Explain the core mechanism in great detail. Add diagrams, tables, code examples wherever they help clarify and sensible to do so. Keep target audience and end goal in mind - no fluff - neutral documentation / tutorial writing style.]

```
<example>
[Core concepts, workflow mechanics, component interactions, data flows, architectural patterns, constraints, limits, or implementation details]
</example>
```

## 🎯 Example
> 💡 *Real scenario with actual data - see it work.*

[Set up the scenario in one sentence. Show real input → transformation → output. Add diagrams, tables, code examples wherever they help clarify and sensible to do so. Keep target audience and end goal in mind - no fluff - neutral documentation / tutorial writing style.]

```
<example>
[Input data, transformation logic, output results, screenshots, code snippets, prompts, responses, configurations, or visual demonstrations]
</example>
```

## 🚶 Workflow Promptorial
> 💡 *How to what, when and where.*

[Lead with action - each step should be immediately actionable. Add diagrams, tables, code examples wherever they help clarify and sensible to do so. Keep target audience and end goal in mind - no fluff - neutral documentation / tutorial writing style.]

### 🎯 Goals
> 💡 *Clear definition(s) of what this workflow aims to accomplish. What are the desired outcomes?*

- <!-- Goal 1: e.g., To streamline the process of X. -->
- <!-- Goal 2: e.g., To ensure consistency in Y. -->
- <!-- Add more goals as needed -->

### 📏 Rules
> 💡 *Guidelines, constraints, and principles to follow when creating, using, or modifying this workflow.*

- <!-- Rule 1: e.g., Treat each new workflow iteration as an MVP. -->
- <!-- Rule 2: e.g., Improve only one aspect at a time. -->
- <!-- Add more rules as needed -->

### 🔭 Scope
> 💡 *Define the boundaries of this workflow. What is included, and what is explicitly excluded?*

**In Scope:**
- <!-- e.g., Creating and maintaining workflow documentation. -->
- <!-- Add more in-scope items -->

**Out of Scope:**
- <!-- e.g., Hosting or deployment of the workflow itself. -->
- <!-- Add more out-of-scope items -->

### 🪜 Steps
> 💡 *The heart of every workflow. All activities, procedures, and results in chronological order.*

#### 📋 Pre-requisites
> 💡 *What needs to be in place or understood before starting the steps? (e.g., tools, access, knowledge)*

- [ ] <!-- Prerequisite 1: e.g., Access to the XYZ tool. -->
- [ ] <!-- Prerequisite 2: e.g., Understanding of ABC concept. -->
- <!-- Add more pre-requisites as needed -->

#### 👣 Activity Flow
> 💡 *Detail each step involved in executing this workflow from start to finish.*

1.  **Step 1: [Action Verb + Task]**
    - <!-- Description or sub-steps for Step 1 -->
    - <!-- Expected result of Step 1 -->
2.  **Step 2: [Action Verb + Task]**
    - <!-- Description or sub-steps for Step 2 -->
    - <!-- Expected result of Step 2 -->
- <!-- Add more steps as needed, following the same format -->

### 💡 Insights
> 💡 *Observations, lessons learned, and ideas for improvement gathered while developing or using the workflow.*

- <!-- Insight 1: e.g., Noticed that Step X is often a bottleneck. -->
- <!-- Insight 2: e.g., Users frequently ask about Y, consider adding it to the description. -->
- <!-- Add more insights as they arise -->

### 🎙️ Final Remarks
> 💡 *Anything else worth mentioning that hasn't been covered? (e.g., disclaimers, acknowledgements, tips)*

<!-- Add any concluding thoughts, important notes, or disclaimers here. -->
