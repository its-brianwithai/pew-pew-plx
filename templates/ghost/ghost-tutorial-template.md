# 🎓 [Tutorial Title]
> 💡 *What you'll learn and why it matters - straight to the point.*

[One sentence hook: what problem this solves. One sentence outcome: what you'll be able to do after. Keep target audience and end goal in mind - no fluff - neutral documentation / tutorial writing style.]

**Time:** [X] minutes

## 📋 Prerequisites
> 💡 *Only the absolute essentials - most tutorials should need nothing.*

[List any truly essential requirements or delete section entirely. Keep target audience and end goal in mind - no fluff - neutral documentation / tutorial writing style.]

```
<example>
- [Tool installations, API keys, file preparations, account setups, or environment configurations]
</example>
```

## 🧠 Theory
> 💡 *How it works under the hood.*

[Explain the core mechanism in great detail. Add diagrams, tables, code examples wherever they help clarify and sensible to do so. Keep target audience and end goal in mind - no fluff - neutral documentation / tutorial writing style.]

```
<example>
[Core concepts, workflow mechanics, component interactions, data flows, architectural patterns, constraints, limits, or implementation details]
</example>
```

## 🎯 Example
> 💡 *Real scenario with actual data - see it work.*

[Set up the scenario in one sentence. Show real input → transformation → output. Add diagrams, tables, code examples wherever they help clarify and sensible to do so. Keep target audience and end goal in mind - no fluff - neutral documentation / tutorial writing style.]

```
<example>
[Input data, transformation logic, output results, screenshots, code snippets, prompts, responses, configurations, or visual demonstrations]
</example>
```

## 🚶 Prompt It Yourself
> 💡 *Step-by-step instructions to implement this yourself.*

[Lead with action - each step should be immediately actionable. Include actual prompts, commands, or code snippets the reader can use. Add diagrams, tables, code examples wherever they help clarify and sensible to do so. Keep target audience and end goal in mind - no fluff - neutral documentation / tutorial writing style.]

### 🎯 Goals
> 💡 *What you'll achieve by following this tutorial.*

[List the specific outcomes the reader will accomplish. Be concrete and measurable.]

```
<example>
- [Primary achievement type, measurable outcome type, capability gained type]
- [Secondary objectives, skills developed, problems solved]
- [...]
</example>
```

### 📏 Instructions
> 💡 *Guidelines and constraints to follow during implementation.*

[List any rules, principles, or constraints that apply throughout the tutorial.]

```
<example>
- [Best practice types, security consideration types, performance guideline types, compatibility requirement types]
- [Additional instruction categories if needed]
- [...]
</example>
```

### 🪜 Steps
> 💡 *The actual implementation process from start to finish.*

[Detailed step-by-step instructions with real examples the reader can use.]

```
<example>
1. [First action type]: [Description of what this action does]
   - [Prompt, command, or code snippet type]
   - [Expected output or result type]
2. [Second action type]: [Description of what this action does]
   - [Configuration or setup type]
   - [Verification step type]
3. [Third action type]: [Description of what this action does]
   - [Implementation detail type]
   - [Testing or validation type]
[...]
</example>
```

## 💡 Insights
> 💡 *Observations and lessons learned from this implementation.*

[Share discoveries, gotchas, and learnings that emerged during development or usage.]

```
<example>
- [Discovery types, gotcha types, performance observation types, alternative approach types]
- [Additional insight categories if needed]
- [...]
</example>
```

## 🎙️ Final Remarks
> 💡 *What we learned and where to go next.*

[One paragraph summary of what was learned and immediate next actions. Add diagrams, tables, code examples wherever they help clarify and sensible to do so. Keep target audience and end goal in mind - no fluff - neutral documentation / tutorial writing style.]

```
<example>
[Key takeaways, related tutorials, external resources, next steps, or follow-up actions]
</example>
