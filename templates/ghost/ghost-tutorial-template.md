# ðŸŽ“ [Tutorial Title]
> ðŸ’¡ *What you'll learn and why it matters - straight to the point.*

[One sentence hook: what problem this solves. One sentence outcome: what you'll be able to do after. Keep target audience and end goal in mind - no fluff - neutral documentation / tutorial writing style.]

**Time:** [X] minutes

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites
> ðŸ’¡ *Only the absolute essentials - most tutorials should need nothing.*

[List any truly essential requirements or delete section entirely. Keep target audience and end goal in mind - no fluff - neutral documentation / tutorial writing style.]

```
<example>
- [Tool installations, API keys, file preparations, account setups, or environment configurations]
</example>
```

## ðŸ§  Theory
> ðŸ’¡ *How it actually works under the hood.*

[Explain the core mechanism in great detail. Add diagrams, tables, code examples wherever they help clarify and sensible to do so. Keep target audience and end goal in mind - no fluff - neutral documentation / tutorial writing style.]

```
<example>
[Core concepts, system mechanics, component interactions, data flows, architectural patterns, constraints, limits, or implementation details]
</example>
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Example
> ðŸ’¡ *Real scenario with actual data - see it work.*

[Set up the scenario in one sentence. Show real input â†’ transformation â†’ output. Add diagrams, tables, code examples wherever they help clarify and sensible to do so. Keep target audience and end goal in mind - no fluff - neutral documentation / tutorial writing style.]

```
<example>
[Input data, transformation logic, output results, screenshots, code snippets, prompts, responses, configurations, or visual demonstrations]
</example>
```

## ðŸš¶ Promptorial
> ðŸ’¡ *Copy-paste steps to replicate the example.*

[Lead with action - each step should be immediately actionable. Add diagrams, tables, code examples wherever they help clarify and sensible to do so. Keep target audience and end goal in mind - no fluff - neutral documentation / tutorial writing style.]

```
<example>
1. [Action verb]: [What to do]
   - [Command, prompt, or instruction to execute]
   - [Validation check or expected result]
2. [Action verb]: [What to do]
3. [Additional numbered steps as needed]
</example>
```

## ðŸ‘‰ Wrap Up
> ðŸ’¡ *What you accomplished and where to go next.*

[One paragraph summary of what was learned and immediate next actions. Add diagrams, tables, code examples wherever they help clarify and sensible to do so. Keep target audience and end goal in mind - no fluff - neutral documentation / tutorial writing style.]

```
<example>
[Key takeaways, related tutorials, external resources, next steps, or follow-up actions]
</example>
```
