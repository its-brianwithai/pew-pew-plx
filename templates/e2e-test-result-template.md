name: e2e-test-result-template
description: Use this when documenting the results of AI-executed e2e tests for Flutter applications. This template captures test execution outcomes, diagnostics, learnings, and actionable next steps for both frontend and backend.
instructions: Make sure that when you implement this template, you don't include these instructions or any other front matter from this template in your work. Output should always and only be the markdown part outside of the front matter. Never include any tags like <example>, <commentary>, or similar tags - these serve only to increase clarity about implementation. Always use single [ ] brackets to indicate instructions the implementer should follow. When referencing other documents from this project, use wikilinks format [[filename]] to reference them. Do not include the file extension or path.

## üîç Scenario Results

> üí° *Detailed breakdown of each test scenario execution with timings and outcomes.*

<example>
### ‚úÖ Scenario 1: Successful User Registration
- **Duration**: 55s
- **Steps Executed**: 14/14
- **Optimizations Applied**:
  - Used 800ms delay after keyboard (from learning log)
  - Applied retry with backoff for backend user validation query
- **Confidence**: High (100% success over 3 runs)

### ‚ùå Scenario 2: Invalid Data Submission
- **Duration**: 1m 10s
- **Steps Executed**: 9/11
- **Failed At**: Step 3.2 - Backend validation
- **Failure Type**: Unexpected Record Found
- **Pattern Match**: Backend validation logic created a record despite UI error.
- **Recovery Attempts**: 1 (failed)
- **Confidence**: Low (failed consistently)
</example>
