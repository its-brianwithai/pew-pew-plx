# Contributing to Ultra Wide Turbo Workspace

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Ultra Wide Turbo Workspace! This document provides guidelines for contributing to this project.

## What to Contribute

We welcome contributions that enhance the template structure and provide general utility, such as:

- New role templates with clear domain focus
- System documentation and instructions
- Prompt templates for common activities
- Scripts that enhance workspace functionality
- Templates for recurring tasks or documents
- Guidelines for specific workflows

## What Not to Contribute

This repository is meant to be a template that others can use as a starting point. Please avoid:

- Personal implementation files or specific project code
- Credentials or sensitive information
- Large binary files or media assets specific to your use case
- Implementation-specific files that would not benefit other users
- Files with hardcoded personal references or organization-specific details

## Contribution Guidelines

When contributing to this workspace framework, please follow these guidelines to ensure consistency and usability for all:

1. **Adhere to naming conventions** - Follow the patterns outlined above to maintain consistency.
2. **Use kebab-case and lowercase** - We write everything in kebab-case and lowercase because it saves time typing without using shift.
3. **Specify domain context** - When creating content related to specific domains, professions, or tools:
   - Include the context in the filename (e.g., `marketing-campaign-template.md`, `content-calendar-system.md`, `design-review-rubric.md`)
   - For technical content, specify the technology (e.g., `python-projects-template.md`, `react-components-system.md`)
4. **Role specificity** - When creating new roles, be specific about their domain expertise when a role already exists, otherwise be general:
   - Technical roles: `python-developer`, `react-frontend-developer`, `data-scientist`
   - Non-technical roles: `content-marketer`, `product-manager`, `ux-researcher`, `social-media-strategist`
5. **Update relevant documentation** - When adding new content or making changes, always update any relevant documentation like README, instructions, docs, prompts, systems, and templates if applicable.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`)
3. Make your changes
4. Ensure your changes follow the guidelines
5. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature-name`)
7. Create a new Pull Request

## Using the Template

When using this template for your own projects:

1. Clone or fork the repository
2. Add your implementation-specific files freely without worry about accidentally committing them
3. Only files explicitly listed in the `.gitignore` will be tracked
4. If you want to commit specific implementation files, you'll need to explicitly add them to the `.gitignore` whitelist

Thank you for contributing to making this workspace better for everyone!
