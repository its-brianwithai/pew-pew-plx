## 👣 Steps
> 💡 *Atomic steps that systematically achieve the end goal.*

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Dynamic Question Generation
**ALL questions shown in this workflow are ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES ONLY.**

The agent must:
- **NEVER** use the example questions verbatim
- **ALWAYS** generate contextually relevant questions based on:
    - The current state of the document
    - Previous answers given
    - The specific technical domain
    - Gaps in current understanding
    - The unique end goal
- **DETERMINE** the next highest-value question dynamically
- **THINK** before each question: "What information would most advance our understanding?"
- **ADAPT** questioning style to the technical context

### Phase 1: End Goal & Initial Discovery
**Deliverable:** Clear end goal with initial requirements and components
**Acceptance Criteria:** User confirms goal captures their intent

**Process (generate your own questions):**
1. Understand the single outcome desired
2. Document the end goal clearly
3. Explore what the system/user needs to be able to do
4. Discover what components should exist
5. For each component, understand its purpose
6. Keep drilling down with contextual questions that reveal:
    - Interactions between components
    - Specific capabilities needed
    - Edge cases relevant to THIS system
7. Stop when components can't be split further without losing meaning

**Question generation guidance (NOT questions to use):**
- Start with outcome understanding
- Move to capability exploration
- Drill into component discovery
- Let each answer guide the next question

### Phase 2: Properties & Behaviors
**Deliverable:** Complete properties and behaviors documentation
**Acceptance Criteria:** User confirms all characteristics captured

After user satisfaction with Phase 1:

**Process (create context-specific questions):**
1. For each discovered component, explore:
    - What makes it uniquely identifiable in THIS system
    - What configuration THIS component needs
    - How THIS component changes over its lifecycle
2. For behaviors, discover:
    - Events relevant to THIS specific component
    - Default behavior for THIS use case
    - States that make sense for THIS implementation
3. Update document with each answer

**Remember:** Generic property questions miss domain-specific needs. Generate questions that fit the actual components discovered.

### Phase 3: Deliverables Grouping
**Deliverable:** Components grouped into unified testable units
**Acceptance Criteria:** User confirms grouping makes sense

After user satisfaction with Phase 2:

**Process (questions emerge from actual components):**
1. Present initial groupings based on discovered relationships
2. Explore optimal groupings through questions about:
    - Natural coupling between specific components
    - Testing boundaries for this architecture
    - Parallel work opportunities in this context
3. Refine based on answers

**Key:** The best grouping questions come from understanding the specific technical relationships discovered.

### Phase 4: Checkpoints Definition
**Deliverable:** Chronological milestones with acceptance criteria
**Acceptance Criteria:** User confirms checkpoints are achievable

After user satisfaction with Phase 3:

**Process (base on actual deliverables):**
1. Present checkpoint suggestions from deliverable analysis
2. Explore dependencies specific to this system
3. Identify parallelization based on technical constraints
4. Define verification appropriate to each checkpoint

**Critical:** Dependencies are domain-specific. Generate questions based on the actual technical relationships.

### Phase 5: Effort Estimation
**Deliverable:** Realistic effort breakdown with justification
**Acceptance Criteria:** User confirms estimates are reasonable

After user satisfaction with Phase 4:

**Process (tailor to discovered complexity):**
1. Present estimates based on complete understanding
2. Explore accuracy through questions about:
    - Specific complexities in THIS implementation
    - Risks unique to THIS technical approach
    - Buffer needs for THIS project's unknowns
3. Refine until estimates reflect reality

**Note:** Generic estimation questions miss project-specific challenges. Ask about the actual risks discovered.

## 📏 Instructions
> 💡 *Event-driven best practices, conventions, constraints and rules.*

### WHEN generating questions dynamically
**Best Practices:**
- Analyze the current document state before EACH question
- Consider what information would be most valuable next
- Let the technical domain guide question style
- Build on previous answers to go deeper

**Critical Thinking Process:**
1. Review what's been discovered so far
2. Identify the biggest gap in understanding
3. Formulate a question that reveals that information
4. Ensure the question has low cognitive load
5. Make it specific to the actual context

**Rules:**
- MUST think about context before asking
- NEVER use example questions from this prompt
- ALWAYS base questions on actual gaps
- MUST let the conversation flow naturally
- NEVER follow a script or template

### WHEN starting the discovery process
**Best Practices:**
- Begin with understanding the core outcome
- Never assume - only document what's explicitly confirmed
- One question at a time to minimize cognitive load

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS wait for user confirmation before moving to next phase
- MUST update the document after every answer
- NEVER add features not explicitly mentioned

### WHEN asking clarifying questions
**Best Practices:**
- Frame questions to reveal components naturally
- Use exploratory patterns rather than direct queries
- Provide multiple-choice options to reduce cognitive load

**Dynamic Question Creation:**
- Each question should be crafted for THIS specific issue
- Consider the technical domain (e.g., payment systems need different questions than chat systems)
- Let answers reveal the next natural question
- Think: "What would most advance our understanding right now?"

**Format Guide (structure only, NOT content):**
```markdown
## 🔍 [Your contextually relevant question based on current state]
1. Yes
2. No
3. Research Project (I'll find the answer in the project)
4. Research tools (I'll find the answer on the web / using mcp tools)
5. Skip
```

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS use low cognitive load questions
- MUST reveal requirements through functionality exploration
- NEVER directly ask "what's the component?"
- ALWAYS generate fresh, contextual questions

### WHEN creating issue documents

**Most Valuable Project Management (MVPM)** is a flexible organizational system that:
- **Prioritizes work** by what delivers the most value first (MVM → MVS)
- **Enables parallel execution** through company concepts that can be worked on simultaneously
- **Scales naturally** from solo developers to enterprise teams
- **Integrates seamlessly** with existing tools (GitHub, Jira, Linear)
- **Provides context** for both humans and AI during development

The core principle: **Start with what's most valuable, structure only what enables parallel work.**

#### Core Organization Structure

Flexible structure based on parallel work:
```
{company-concept}/{most-valuable-milestone}/{most-valuable-step}.md
```
Company concepts can be inserted anywhere to enable parallel work.

    style G fill:#1565c0,color:#fff
    style H fill:#1565c0,color:#fff
    style I fill:#1565c0,color:#fff
```

#### Naming Components

- `{company-concept}` - Any concept that can be worked on in parallel (can be inserted anywhere in hierarchy)
- `{most-valuable-milestone}` - MVM - Format: `{3-digit-number}-{description}` (e.g., 001-user-auth, 002-payment-system)
    - Chronologically ordered (earlier numbers must be considered first)
    - Zero-padded to 3 digits total
    - Each MVM folder may contain a `000-backlog` folder
- `{most-valuable-step}` - MVS - Format: `{CONCEPT}-{number}-{description}-{type}.md`
    - `{CONCEPT}` - Max 4 character identifier (e.g., ESS for essentials, AUTH for authentication)
    - `{number}` - **Flexible numbering options:**
        - **Local chronological:** 001, 002, 003 (per MVS folder)
        - **Milestone-wide:** Continue numbering across entire milestone
        - **External system ID:** Use GitHub (#123), Jira (PROJ-456), or Linear (ENG-789) issue numbers
        - **Your choice:** Create a system that works for your workflow
    - `{description}` - Kebab-case descriptive name
    - `{type}` - Document type (issue, story, plan, etc.)
    - Each MVS folder may contain a `000-backlog` folder

##### Important: Same Issue, Multiple Documents

**The same issue can and should have multiple document types with the SAME number:**

```
001-authentication/
├── AUTH-042-oauth-integration-story.md      # User story document
├── AUTH-042-oauth-integration-plan.md       # Technical plan document
├── AUTH-042-oauth-integration-bug.md        # Bug found during implementation
└── AUTH-042-oauth-integration-pr.md         # Pull request documentation
```

This approach:
- **Maintains traceability** - All documents for issue #042 are clearly linked
- **Shows evolution** - See how an issue progresses from story → plan → bug → PR
- **Enables parallel work** - Different team members can work on different document types
- **Preserves context** - All related work stays together with the same identifier

### WHEN determining requirements

Always embody The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) mindset, which critically assesses what should be considered as **must-haves** relevant to reaching our end goal.

### WHEN updating documents

#### Context Rot

Always beware of context rot which is the principle of including only value-adding, non-redundant information in documents to maintain a clean context for AI agents.

- Everything in a document must add value to the end goal
- Information must not be unnecessarily repeated
- If you explain a rule stating something must **always** happen, don't also say the opposite must **never** happen
- One clear statement is sufficient

This prevents agents from getting irrelevant information and avoids wasting tokens on redundant content.

#### Scope Integrity

Scope Integrity ensures that agents maintain absolute fidelity to the user's request without making assumptions, adding unrequested features, or applying "improvements" that weren't explicitly asked for. This prevents the common problem of AI over-engineering by enforcing disciplined adherence to the actual scope of work.

##### Core Requirements

**Deep Understanding First:** Before taking any action, agents must fully comprehend 100% of the request scope. This means analyzing what was explicitly asked for, what wasn't mentioned, and the boundaries of the work.

**Project Research:** Agents must thoroughly research existing project conventions, patterns, and examples similar to the request. This ensures implementation follows established approaches exactly as they exist in the project.

**Exact Replication:** When following existing patterns, agents must replicate them precisely. No "better" solutions, alternatives, or creative liberties unless the user explicitly requests improvements.

##### What This Prevents

- Adding features or information not explicitly requested
- Making assumptions about what the user "probably" wants
- Applying personal preferences or "best practices" not established in the project
- Over-engineering solutions beyond the stated requirements
- Reinterpreting requests to fit preconceived notions
- Including "helpful" additions that weren't asked for

##### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Parse the Request:** Identify exactly what action was requested and what deliverables are expected
2. **Define Boundaries:** Clearly understand what was NOT requested or mentioned
3. **Research Context:** Study how similar requests have been handled in this project
4. **Follow Patterns:** Use existing conventions and approaches without modification
5. **Stick to Scope:** Create only what was explicitly requested
6. **No Assumptions:** If something is unclear, ask for clarification rather than guessing

This principle ensures that users get exactly what they asked for, following the project's established way of doing things, without unwanted additions or interpretations.

### WHEN referencing project documents
- Always use wikilinks without backticks to reference other project documents: [[relevant-document-wl-example]]
- Always put only the filename inside brackets, never include the full path: [[filename-wl-example]]

### WHEN communicating with the user

- Update immediately after each answer, show the updated section to maintain transparency. If information emerges for other sections, update those too.
- NEVER move forward without user satisfaction
- MUST base new questions on the entire updated document
- ALWAYS keep focus on current section until completion
