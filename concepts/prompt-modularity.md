# ðŸ’¡ Concept: Prompt Modularity
> ðŸ’¡ *The principle of building prompts from reusable, modular components.*

The modular prompt philosophy is central to this project. Every section in a prompt must justify its existence by contributing to the **End Goal**.

The evolution path for components is:
1.  **Inline**: Start with all content inside a single prompt.
2.  **Extract**: Identify a reusable pattern and move it to its own file (e.g., a block, persona, or workflow).
3.  **Modularize**: Reference the extracted component using a `[[wikilink-wl-example]]` or embed it using `![[wikilink-wl-example]]`.
4.  **Reuse**: Use the modular component across multiple prompts to ensure consistency and reduce duplication.

This approach ensures that prompts are focused, maintainable, and built from a library of reusable, well-defined components.
