# ðŸ’¡ Concept: MVP Mindset
> ðŸ’¡ *The principle of focusing exclusively on must-have requirements to deliver value quickly.*

The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) mindset always focuses on the **must-haves**. It looks at what delivers the most value at that moment and makes sure we donâ€™t describe or do anything that isnâ€™t needed to keep the goal on track. The must-haves are what weâ€™re working toward.
