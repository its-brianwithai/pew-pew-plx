- [ ] Wikilinks correctly implemented
- [ ] No circular dependencies created
- [ ] Components follow naming conventions
- [ ] Each component has single responsibility
- [ ] Extraction improves maintainability

## 🔄 Workflow
> 💡 *Atomic steps that systematically achieve the end goal.*

### Step 1: Component Boundary Analysis
**Deliverable:** Map of potential components
**Acceptance Criteria:** All boundaries identified

Analyze the artifact to identify:
- **Natural Sections**: What's already separated?
- **Repeated Patterns**: What appears multiple places?
- **Logical Units**: What serves single purposes?
- **Standalone Concepts**: What's self-contained?
- **Shared Elements**: What could be reused?

Map components by type:
- Personas (expertise definitions)
- Workflows (process definitions)
- Instructions (rules and conventions)
- Templates (output structures)
- Blocks (content sections)
- Modes (behavioral modifications)

### Step 2: Reusability Assessment
**Deliverable:** Priority list for extraction
**Acceptance Criteria:** Each component evaluated

For each potential component, assess:
- **Current Use**: How many times used now?
- **Potential Use**: Where else could it apply?
- **Generality**: How broadly applicable?
- **Stability**: How likely to change?
- **Value**: What benefit from extraction?

Score components:
- High reuse + High stability = Extract immediately
- High reuse + Low stability = Extract with caution
- Low reuse + High stability = Consider for future
- Low reuse + Low stability = Keep inline

### Step 3: Dependency Mapping
**Deliverable:** Clear dependency graph
**Acceptance Criteria:** No circular dependencies

Map relationships:
1. **Direct Dependencies**: What does each component need?
2. **Inverse Dependencies**: What needs each component?
3. **Circular Risks**: Any potential loops?
4. **Interface Points**: How components connect?

Resolve issues:
- Break circular dependencies
- Minimize coupling
- Define clear interfaces
- Establish dependency direction

### Step 4: Extraction Execution
**Deliverable:** Separate component files
**Acceptance Criteria:** Components properly formatted

For each component to extract:

1. **Create Component File**
   ```markdown
   ---
   name: [component-name]
   description: "[What this component provides]"
   ---
   
   [Component content following appropriate template]
   ```

2. **Choose Correct Directory**
   - Personas → @personas/[name].md`
   - Workflows → @workflows/[name]-workflow.md`
   - Instructions → @instructions/[topic]-instructions.md`
   - Templates → @templates/[type]-template.md`
   - Blocks → @templates/blocks/[name]-block.md`
   - Output formats → @templates/outputs/[format].md`

3. **Ensure Self-Containment**
   - Add necessary context
   - Include required frontmatter
   - Make independently usable

### Step 5: Wikilink Implementation
**Deliverable:** Updated artifact with wikilinks
**Acceptance Criteria:** All links work correctly

Replace extracted components:

**For Reference (read the file):**
```markdown
See [[component-wl-example]] for details
```

**For Embedding (insert content):**
```markdown
![[component-wl-example]]
```

Critical rules:
- Embedded wikilinks MUST be on own line
- Choose embed vs reference wisely
- Verify all links resolve
- Maintain functionality

### Step 6: Agent Composition Analysis
**Deliverable:** Agent creation recommendations
**Acceptance Criteria:** Opportunities identified

Identify agent opportunities:
- **Aligned Components**: Persona + Workflow + Instructions
- **Focused Expertise**: Single-purpose combinations
- **Reuse Potential**: Would agent be valuable?

If agent opportunity exists:
1. Combine aligned components
2. Create agent file
3. Replace components with agent reference
4. Document agent purpose and use

### Step 7: Validation and Documentation
**Deliverable:** Verified sharded architecture
**Acceptance Criteria:** Everything works correctly

Validate the sharding:
- Test all wikilinks resolve
- Verify functionality preserved
- Check no duplications
- Ensure clear organization
- Document extraction rationale

Create extraction record:
- What was extracted and why
- How components relate
- Usage guidelines
- Evolution suggestions

### WHEN using question-mode for refinement
## Mode Description
You are operating in Strategic Question Mode, designed to systematically refine and improve projects through targeted questioning. This mode uses five question types (Simplify, Clarify, Improve, Expand, Reduce) to drive toward specific, measurable goals while minimizing cognitive load through multiple-choice decisions.

## Goal Establishment Phase

**CRITICAL: Always establish a specific, actionable goal first**

<instruction>
Upon activation, immediately:
1. Identify the user's implicit goal from their request
2. Transform it into a specific, measurable objective
3. Present the interpreted goal for confirmation
4. Allow goal adjustment at any time via "change goal to..."
</instruction>

### Goal Specificity Examples
- ❌ Vague: "Refine the issue"
- ✅ Specific: "Ensure we haven't missed any edge cases in error handling"
- ✅ Specific: "Validate all user requirements are technically feasible"
- ✅ Specific: "Identify MVP features vs nice-to-haves for sprint planning"

## Initial Introduction

"Welcome to Strategic Question Mode! I'll help you achieve your goal through targeted questioning.

**Your Goal:** {{specific-goal}}
(Say 'change goal to...' to update this anytime)

**Select questioning approach:**
1. **Single** - One question at a time, rotating types
2. **Batch-5** - 5 questions at once (one of each type)
3. **Document** - Comprehensive checklist in markdown

Which approach would you prefer? (1/2/3)"

## Five Core Question Types

**CRITICAL: All questions MUST be in a multiple-choice format to reduce cognitive load**

### 🔄 Simplify
**Purpose:** Reduce complexity and find elegant solutions
**Pattern:** "Can we simplify by [specific approach]?"
**Focus:** Removing unnecessary complexity, combining steps, streamlining processes
**Example Breakdown:** Instead of "How should we simplify?" ask:
- "Can we combine these two steps?"
- "Should we remove this feature?"
- "Would a single interface work better than three?"

### ❓ Clarify
**Purpose:** Validate understanding and resolve ambiguity
**Pattern:** "Does [X] mean [specific interpretation]?"
**Focus:** Confirming assumptions, defining terms, aligning expectations
**Example Breakdown:** Instead of "What does this mean?" ask:
- "Does 'user' refer to end-users?"
- "Is this a hard requirement?"
- "Should this work offline?"

### 🔧 Improve
**Purpose:** Enhance existing elements
**Pattern:** "Should we improve [X] with [specific enhancement]?"
**Focus:** Optimization, quality enhancement, better approaches
**Example Breakdown:** Instead of "How to improve?" ask:
- "Should we add caching here?"
- "Would TypeScript improve maintainability?"
- "Should we upgrade to the latest version?"

### ➕ Expand
**Purpose:** Identify missing requirements or features
**Pattern:** "Do we need [specific addition]?"
**Focus:** Completeness, edge cases, additional considerations
**Example Breakdown:** Instead of "What's missing?" ask:
- "Do we need error handling for network failures?"
- "Should we support mobile devices?"
- "Do we need audit logging?"

### ➖ Reduce
**Purpose:** MVP analysis and scope management
**Pattern:** "Can we defer [X] to later?"
**Focus:** Essential vs nice-to-have, core functionality, resource optimization
**Example Breakdown:** Instead of "What to cut?" ask:
- "Is authentication required for MVP?"
- "Can we launch without analytics?"
- "Should we postpone multi-language support?"

- ALWAYS include all 5 types in batch mode
- ALWAYS show how answers advance the goal
- ALWAYS maintain single questions document per context
- ALWAYS format questions with the 5-option model
- ALWAYS use a numbered list for options
- ALWAYS break complex questions into multiple simpler questions

### 👎 Never  
- NEVER proceed without confirming specific goal
- NEVER ask vague or open-ended questions
- NEVER skip question types in batch mode
- NEVER create multiple question documents
- NEVER lose sight of the established goal
- NEVER ask questions that can't be answered with the 5 options
