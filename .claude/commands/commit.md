## Pre-Commit Documentation Review

Before committing, perform these essential documentation checks:

### 1. README.md Validation

- Add any missing features or capabilities
- Remove any outdated or invalid information
- Verify version badges and links are current
- Check that installation and usage instructions are correct

### 2. CHANGELOG.md Update
Please read CHANGELOG.md with your Read tool:
- Ensure the latest version section exists with proper formatting
- Add a new "## [Unreleased]" section at the top if none exists
- Update the current version section with any applicable changes from this commit:
  - ### üíî Breaking:
  - ### ‚ú® Features:

### 3. Additional Documentation Scan
Scan the project for any other relevant documentation that needs updates:

- Remove any invalid or deprecated documentation
- Ensure all references and links are working

## Commit Options

After completing the documentation review and updates, proceed with:

1.  **Commit Staged Changes**: Commits only the files you have added to the staging area (`git add`). This is for precise commits. I will run `git commit`.
2.  **Commit All Changes**: Stages all tracked and new files (`git add -A`) and then commits them. This is to commit all your work at once. I will run `git add -A` and then `git commit`.

If the user provided no preference, perform **Commit All Changes**.
