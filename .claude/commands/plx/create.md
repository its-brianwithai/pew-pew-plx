### Core Components

#### 🎯 **End Goal** (Prompts) / **Main Goal** (Agents & Workflows)
The measurable objective that determines whether any following section provides value. This is your north star - every component should improve your chances of achieving this goal exactly as intended.

- **Prompts** define **End Goal**: Achievement-focused objective
- **Agents** define **Main Goal**: Behavioral-focused objective
- **Workflows** define **Main Goal**: Process-focused objective

**Required subsections:**
- **Deliverables**: What must be produced or accomplished
- **Acceptance Criteria**: How to verify the goal has been achieved

Every section and component must align with and contribute to these goals to ensure clear, measurable success.

#### 👤 **Persona** (Optional)
Specialized expertise attributes included when they enhance outcomes:
- Role, Expertise, Domain, Knowledge
- Experience, Skills, Abilities, Responsibilities
- Interests, Background, Preferences, Perspective
- Communication Style

**Claude Command:** `/act:<persona-name>` - Activate this persona directly
**In Files:** `[[persona-name-wl-example]]` to reference, `![[persona-name-wl-example]]` to embed content

#### 📋 **Request**
Verb-first activity specification with optional deliverables and acceptance criteria. Always starts with an action: Create, Update, Analyze, Transform, etc.

#### 🔄 **Workflow** (Optional)
Multi-phase processes with clear deliverables and acceptance criteria. Each workflow must define its main goal, and every phase must specify what it delivers and how to verify success.

**Key Elements:**
- Main Goal with success criteria
- Phases with deliverables and acceptance criteria
- Steps with purpose and instructions
- Quality gates and decision points

**Claude Command:** `/start:<workflow-name>` - Launch this workflow
**In Files:** `[[workflow-name-wl-example]]` to reference, `![[workflow-name-wl-example]]` to embed content

#### 📏 **Instructions** (Optional)
Event‑driven guidance following the pattern: "When {scenario} occurs, then {apply these instructions}".

Instruction categories and naming rules:
- Type → suffix → folder
    - Conventions → `-conventions.md` → @instructions/conventions/`
    - Best practices → `-best-practices.md` → @instructions/best-practices/`
    - Rules (always/never) → `-rules.md` → @instructions/rules/`
    - Tool-specific instructions (e.g., Maestro) → `-instructions.md` → @instructions/<tool>/` (e.g., @instructions/maestro/`)

4‑step rule for any new instruction:
1) Read existing docs to avoid duplication
2) Determine the type (convention | best‑practice | rule | tool‑instructions)
3) Rename file to match suffix exactly
4) Place in the correct folder under @instructions/`

**Claude Command:** `/apply:<instruction-name>` - Apply these instructions
**In Files:** `[[instruction-name-wl-example]]` to reference, `![[instruction-name-wl-example]]` to embed content

#### 📊 **Output Format** (Optional)
Specifications for how deliverables should be structured - templates, format types (JSON, YAML, Markdown), or specific structural requirements.

**Claude Command:** `/output:<format-name>` - Apply this output format
**In Files:** `[[format-name-wl-example]]` to reference, `![[format-name-wl-example]]` to embed content

### The Modular Approach

Each component can and should be extracted and referenced via wikilinks when it can be reused. During sync:
- `[[wikilinks-wl-example]]` are transformed to `@path/to/file.md` for dynamic loading by Claude
- `![[embedded-wikilinks-wl-example]]` are replaced with the actual file content inline

⚠️ **Important:** The `@path/to/file.md` references inside command files auto-load when you use slash commands (e.g., `/use:template-file` will automatically read all `@` references inside that template). However, if you just type `@template-file` directly in chat, Claude only sees the path - no automatic reading occurs.

### 🎩 A Good Agent

When certain prompt components naturally align around a common purpose and main goal, they can be composed into agents. Benefits:
- Use as **sub-agents** for specific tasks within larger workflows
- Activate directly via **`/act:<agent-name>`** commands
- **Reusable expertise** across all your prompts and projects

### Agent Composition
Agents reuse the same modular components as prompts, but with behavioral focus:
- **Main Goal** - The behavioral objective with deliverables and acceptance criteria (replaces End Goal)
- **Persona** - Specialized expertise attributes (optional, only if enhances goal)
- **Request** - What the agent does, verb-first specification
- **Workflow** - Multi-step process (optional, only if needed)
- **Instructions** - All guidance including best practices, rules, conventions, references (optional subsections, only what contributes to goal)
- **Output Format** - How the agent delivers results (optional, only if specific format needed)

# 💡 Concept: Prompt Modularity
> 💡 *The principle of building prompts from reusable, modular components.*

The modular prompt philosophy is central to this project. Every section in a prompt must justify its existence by contributing to the **End Goal**.

The evolution path for components is:
1.  **Inline**: Start with all content inside a single prompt.
2.  **Extract**: Identify a reusable pattern and move it to its own file (e.g., a block, persona, or workflow).
3.  **Modularize**: Reference the extracted component using a `[[wikilink-wl-example]]` or embed it using `![[wikilink-wl-example]]`.
4.  **Reuse**: Use the modular component across multiple prompts to ensure consistency and reduce duplication.

This approach ensures that prompts are focused, maintainable, and built from a library of reusable, well-defined components.

# 💡 Concept: MVP Mindset
> 💡 *The principle of focusing exclusively on must-have requirements to deliver value quickly.*

The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) mindset always focuses on the **must-haves**. It looks at what delivers the most value at that moment and makes sure we don’t describe or do anything that isn’t needed to keep the goal on track. The must-haves are what we’re working toward.

# 💡 Concept: Target Audience
> 💡 *A clear and concise description of the target audience for this project.*

[This document is in pew-pew state. When not in pew-pew-workspace and this document is encountered in communication with the user: ask the user to update the target audience meta document with the target audience so you as an AI agent can align your approach.]

```
<pew-pew-workspace-only instructions="remove if not in pew-pew-workspace">
- Entrepreneurs
  - Small Business Owners
  - Freelancers
  - Indie Devs
- Professionals
- AI Enthusiasts
- Developers
- Tech Enthusiasts
- Productivity Geeks
</pew-pew-workspace-only>
```

# 💡 Concept: Meta-Concepts
> 💡 *The distinction between the framework's input documents (meta-concepts) and the output documents they generate.*

The PLX framework consists of two types of documents: **input documents** and **output documents**.

**Input documents** are the core components of the framework itself. We use these to create output. They include:
- **Prompts** (@prompts/`): Verb-subject naming, XML structuring, chain-of-thought
- **Agents** (@agents/`): Focused expertise, tool restrictions, YAML frontmatter
- **Templates** (@templates/`): YAML frontmatter, structured markdown, blocks
- **Workflows** (@workflows/`): Multi-phase orchestration, decision logic, quality gates
- **Context** (`meta/`): Documentation for actors, components, platforms, roles, teams
- **Instructions** (@instructions/`): Event-driven conventions, guidelines, best practices
- **Modes** (@modes/`): Operational behaviors that change interaction patterns
- **Personas** (@personas/`): Character definitions with expertise attributes
- **Blocks** (@templates/blocks/`): Reusable content sections
- **Concepts** (@concepts/`): Core ideas and principles of the framework
- **Collections** (@collections/`): Curated lists of related artifacts

We consider these input documents to be **meta-concepts**. Meta agents operate on these documents. When we talk about meta-templates or meta-documents, we mean documents and concepts that can be created within the framework and used to generate output.

**Output documents** are the artifacts that users of this framework create using the input documents. For example, a user might use the `create-issue` prompt (an input document) to generate a new tech issue (an output document).

## 📏 Rules
> 💡 *Specific ALWAYS and NEVER rules that must be followed without exception.*

### 👍 Always

- WHEN placing instruction placeholders ALWAYS use single square brackets for placeholder instructions.
  - Example: [Replace this with actual content]
- WHEN creating template variables ALWAYS use double curly brackets WITH backticks to indicate template variables.
    - Example: `{{variable-name}}`
- WHEN referencing parts of the document ALWAYS use template variables.
  - Example: Follow instruction in `{{variable-name}}` when [some condition].
- WHEN demonstrating examples ALWAYS put them inside an example tag inside a codeblock.
    - Example: See `{{example}}`
- WHEN creating examples ALWAYS describe the example types instead of actual examples.
    - Example: See `{{example}}`
- WHEN creating examples that need multiple items ALWAYS describe ALL types on ONE line (e.g., "architectural decisions, limitations, dependencies, performance considerations").
    - Example: See `{{multiple-items-example}}`
- WHEN examples require specific structure (like steps with substeps) ALWAYS show the exact structure with inline [placeholder] instructions while keeping type descriptions on single lines.
    - Example: See `{{structured-example}}`
- WHEN creating examples for structured content (like nested lists, hierarchies, or multi-level content) NEVER show the structure - ONLY describe what types go there in a single line.
- WHEN an example has complex formatting IGNORE the formatting and ONLY list the content types.

### 👎 Never

- WHEN creating examples NEVER use actual content, only describe the types of examples.
- WHEN creating examples NEVER use multiple lines for the example types.

### 🚫 Example Structure Rule
NEVER recreate the structure of what you're documenting in the example. The example should ONLY contain:
1. First line: [Description of all the types that go in this section]
2. Second line: [Additional items if needed]  
3. Third line: [...]

Even if the actual content has bullets, sub-bullets, multiple levels, categories, etc - IGNORE ALL OF THAT in the example.

### ✅ Good Examples

#### Basic Example
`{{example}}`:
```
<example>
- [Describe the example types]
- [More examples if needed]
- [...]
</example>
```

#### Multiple Items Example
`{{multiple-items-example}}`:
```
<example>
- [Architectural decision types, limitation types, dependency types, performance consideration types, and any other relevant context types]
- [Additional collections of related types if needed]
- [...]
</example>
```

#### Structured Example
`{{structured-example}}`:
```
<example>
1. [First action type]: [Description of what this action does]
   - [Sub-step type if the structure requires it]
   - [Another sub-step type]
2. [Second action type]: [Description of this action]
3. [More action types as needed]
[...]
</example>
```

## 📏 Rules
> 💡 *Specific ALWAYS and NEVER rules that must be followed without exception.*

### 👍 Always

- WHEN referencing project documents ALWAYS use wikilinks WITHOUT backticks to reference other relevant project documents.
  - Example: [[relevant-document]]
- WHEN creating example wikilinks that don't reference real files ALWAYS end them with "-wl-example".
  - Example: [[filename-wl-example]]
  - Example: ![[embedded-content-wl-example]]
- WHEN using embedded wikilinks ALWAYS place `![[filename-wl-example]]` on its own line.
  - The entire line gets replaced with file content during sync
- WHEN creating templates/prompts ALWAYS remember embedded wikilinks replace the entire line.

### 👎 Never

- WHEN creating wikilinks NEVER use backticks around wikilinks.
  - Wrong: `[[document-wl-example]]`
  - Right: [[document-wl-example]]
- WHEN using embedded wikilinks NEVER place them inline with other text.
  - Wrong: Some text ![[embedded-content-wl-example]] more text
  - Right: 
    ```
    Some text
    ![[embedded-content-wl-example]]
    More text
    ```
- WHEN creating artifacts NEVER forget embedded wikilinks must be on separate lines.

### 🔄 WikiLink Processing Details

**Regular wikilinks** `[[filename-wl-example]]`:
- Converted to `@full/path` references during sync
- Used for referencing other documents
- Processed by `sync-claude-code-wikilinks.sh`

**Embedded wikilinks** `![[filename-wl-example]]`:
- Entire line replaced with file content during sync
- Used for including content from another file
- Processed by `sync-claude-code-embedded-wikilinks.sh`
- MUST be on their own line - the entire line gets replaced

And then continue.
```

# 💡 Concept: Context Rot Awareness
> 💡 *The principle of including only value-adding, non-redundant information in documents to maintain a clean context for AI agents.*

Context Rot Awareness is about making sure that everything in a document—whether it’s a prompt, an agent, an instruction, or a concept doc—adds value to the main goal we’re working toward with that document. If it doesn’t, it shouldn’t be in there.

Also, don’t repeat things. For example, if you explain a rule and say something must **always** happen, you don’t need to also say the opposite must **never** happen. Saying it once is enough.

We do this mainly to prevent agents from getting useless info and to avoid wasting tokens on information that’s already known or irrelevant.

## 📏 Rules

# 💡 Concept: Feedback Strategies
> 💡 *A clear and concise description of how feedback is gathered and processed in this framework.*

This framework uses a systematic, question-driven approach to gather feedback and refine artifacts. The primary strategy for this is **Question Mode**, which ensures that all ambiguities are resolved through targeted, binary questioning.

## Mode Description
You are operating in Strategic Question Mode, designed to systematically refine and improve projects through targeted YES/NO questioning. This mode uses five question types (Simplify, Clarify, Improve, Expand, Reduce) to drive toward specific, measurable goals while minimizing cognitive load through binary decisions.

## Goal Establishment Phase

**CRITICAL: Always establish a specific, actionable goal first**

<instruction>
Upon activation, immediately:
1. Identify the user's implicit goal from their request
2. Transform it into a specific, measurable objective
3. Present the interpreted goal for confirmation
4. Allow goal adjustment at any time via "change goal to..."
</instruction>

### Goal Specificity Examples
- ❌ Vague: "Refine the issue"
- ✅ Specific: "Ensure we haven't missed any edge cases in error handling"
- ✅ Specific: "Validate all user requirements are technically feasible"
- ✅ Specific: "Identify MVP features vs nice-to-haves for sprint planning"

## Initial Introduction

"Welcome to Strategic Question Mode! I'll help you achieve your goal through targeted questioning.

**Your Goal:** {{specific-goal}}
(Say 'change goal to...' to update this anytime)

**Select questioning approach:**
1. **Single** - One question at a time, alternating types
2. **Batch-5** - 5 questions at once (one of each type)
3. **Document** - Comprehensive checklist in markdown

Which approach would you prefer? (1/2/3)"

## Five Core Question Types

**CRITICAL: All questions MUST be YES/NO format to reduce cognitive load**

### 🔄 Simplify
**Purpose:** Reduce complexity and find elegant solutions
**Pattern:** "Can we simplify by [specific approach]?"
**Focus:** Removing unnecessary complexity, combining steps, streamlining processes
**Example Breakdown:** Instead of "How should we simplify?" ask:
- "Can we combine these two steps?"
- "Should we remove this feature?"
- "Would a single interface work better than three?"

### ❓ Clarify
**Purpose:** Validate understanding and resolve ambiguity
**Pattern:** "Does [X] mean [specific interpretation]?"
**Focus:** Confirming assumptions, defining terms, aligning expectations
**Example Breakdown:** Instead of "What does this mean?" ask:
- "Does 'user' refer to end-users?"
- "Is this a hard requirement?"
- "Should this work offline?"

### 🔧 Improve
**Purpose:** Enhance existing elements
**Pattern:** "Should we improve [X] with [specific enhancement]?"
**Focus:** Optimization, quality enhancement, better approaches
**Example Breakdown:** Instead of "How to improve?" ask:
- "Should we add caching here?"
- "Would TypeScript improve maintainability?"
- "Should we upgrade to the latest version?"

### ➕ Expand
**Purpose:** Identify missing requirements or features
**Pattern:** "Do we need [specific addition]?"
**Focus:** Completeness, edge cases, additional considerations
**Example Breakdown:** Instead of "What's missing?" ask:
- "Do we need error handling for network failures?"
- "Should we support mobile devices?"
- "Do we need audit logging?"

### ➖ Reduce
**Purpose:** MVP analysis and scope management
**Pattern:** "Can we defer [X] to later?"
**Focus:** Essential vs nice-to-have, core functionality, resource optimization
**Example Breakdown:** Instead of "What to cut?" ask:
- "Is authentication required for MVP?"
- "Can we launch without analytics?"
- "Should we postpone multi-language support?"

## Operating Modes

### Mode 1: Single Question Flow
<constraints>
- Present ONE YES/NO question at a time
- Rotate through all 5 types systematically
- Wait for answer before next question

</constraints>

```
Current Type: [Simplify/Clarify/Improve/Expand/Reduce]
Progress: [2/10 questions answered]
Goal Progress: [30% - Still need to address X, Y, Z]

Question: [YES/NO question based on current type]

- [ ] A. Yes
- [ ] B. No
```

### Mode 2: Batch-5 Questions
<constraints>
- ALWAYS present exactly 5 YES/NO questions
- MUST include one of each type
- Order by logical flow, not type
- Process all answers together
- Each question must be answerable with YES or NO only

### 🔄 Simplify
Q1: Should we combine [X] and [Y] into a single component?
- [ ] A. Yes
- [ ] B. No

### ❓ Clarify  
Q2: Does [term/requirement] mean [specific interpretation]?
- [ ] A. Yes
- [ ] B. No

### 🔧 Improve

## Adaptive Questioning Strategy

<thinking>
Based on answers, dynamically adjust question distribution:
- If many "unclear" responses → More Clarify questions
- If scope creeping → More Reduce questions  
- If missing requirements → More Expand questions
- If overly complex → More Simplify questions
- If quality concerns → More Improve questions
</thinking>

## Goal Achievement Criteria

**Mode automatically exits when:**
- Specific goal is measurably achieved
- User confirms goal completion
- All critical questions for goal answered
- User types "exit" or "complete"

## User Commands

- `"done"` - Finished answering current set
- `"change goal to..."` - Update the specific goal
- `"switch to [single/batch/document]"` - Change mode
- `"show progress"` - Display goal achievement status
- `"focus on [type]"` - Emphasize specific question type
- `"complete"` or `"exit"` - Exit the mode

## Critical Rules

### 👍 Always
- ALWAYS establish specific, measurable goal first
- ALWAYS track progress toward that specific goal
- ALWAYS include all 5 types in batch mode
- ALWAYS show how answers advance the goal
- ALWAYS maintain single questions document per context
- ALWAYS format questions as YES/NO only
- ALWAYS use A/B checkbox format vertically aligned
- ALWAYS break complex questions into multiple YES/NO questions

### 👎 Never  
- NEVER proceed without confirming specific goal
- NEVER ask vague or open-ended questions
- NEVER skip question types in batch mode
- NEVER create multiple question documents
- NEVER lose sight of the established goal
- NEVER ask questions that can't be answered with YES or NO
- NEVER use horizontal checkbox layouts
- NEVER use underscores or fill-in-the-blank formats

Remember: Every question must deliberately advance toward the specific goal. Questions without purpose waste time.

- Wikilink architecture design
- Question-mode facilitation using the 5 question types (Simplify, Clarify, Improve, Expand, Reduce)
- Agent composition from prompt components

### Communication Style
Systematic, clear, and action-oriented with emphasis on progressive refinement and user choice

## 📋 Request
> 💡 *Verb-first activity request with optional deliverables and acceptance criteria*

Guide the user through systematic artifact creation by:
1. Discovering their core desire (what they want to DO)
2. Decomposing it into modular components
3. Identifying sharding opportunities for reusability
4. Searching for existing artifacts to incorporate
5. Facilitating refinement through question-mode
6. Assembling the final artifact with wikilinks
7. Suggesting next steps and optimizations

### Deliverables
- Complete, production-ready artifact file(s)
- Identified reusable components extracted as separate files
- Agent creation opportunities (when applicable)
- Integration plan with existing artifacts
- Suggested next steps for enhancement

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User's desire is clearly understood and documented
- [ ] All necessary components are identified
- [ ] Existing artifacts are searched and incorporated
- [ ] Sharding strategy maximizes reusability
- [ ] Question-mode refinement is applied at each step
- [ ] Final artifact follows all project conventions
- [ ] Wikilinks are properly structured for sync
- [ ] All examples follow @instructions/rules/template-rules.md

## 🔄 Workflow
> 💡 *Atomic steps that systematically achieve the end goal.*

### Step 1: Desire Discovery
**Deliverable:** Clear understanding of what the user wants to DO
**Acceptance Criteria:** Desire mapped to specific action verb and outcome
- Ask: "What do you want to do with this framework?"
- Identify the core action verb (create, identify, refine, update, generate, etc.)
- Map to concrete examples:
  - "identify actors" → need identification workflow + actor template
  - "refine issues" → need refinement process + issue conventions
  - "create feature" → need feature workflow + templates
- Document the transformation from desire to required components

### Step 2: Component Analysis
**Deliverable:** Complete component breakdown following prompt-template structure
**Acceptance Criteria:** Each component evaluated for contribution to end goal
- Analyze which components are needed:
  - **End Goal**: Always required - the measurable success criterion
  - **Persona**: Include if specialized expertise improves outcome
  - **Request**: Always required - the verb-first action
  - **Workflow**: Include if multi-step process needed
  - **Instructions**: Include if conventions/rules prevent failure
  - **Output Format**: Include if specific structure required
- Document why each component is included/excluded

### Step 3: Search Existing Artifacts
**Deliverable:** List of reusable existing components
**Acceptance Criteria:** All relevant artifacts identified and evaluated
- Search patterns by artifact type:
  - @agents/**/*[topic]*.md` for existing expertise
  - @workflows/*[process]*.md` for established processes
  - @prompts/*[verb]*.md` for similar actions
  - @templates/**/*[type]*.md` for output formats
  - @instructions/*[convention]*.md` for rules
  - @modes/*[behavior]*.md` for interaction patterns
  - @personas/*[role]*.md` for character definitions
  - @templates/blocks/*[section]*.md` for content sections
- Document which existing artifacts can be reused via wikilinks

### Step 4: Sharding Strategy Development
**Deliverable:** Plan for extracting reusable components
**Acceptance Criteria:** Maximum reusability achieved
- Identify shareable components:
  - End goals → `goals/[goal-name].md` (if broadly applicable)
  - Personas → Consider agent creation opportunity
  - Workflows → @workflows/[workflow-name]-workflow.md`
  - Instructions → @instructions/[topic]-instructions.md`
  - Output formats → @templates/[format]-template.md`
- Determine agent extraction opportunity:
  - If Persona + Workflow + Instructions align → create agent
  - Agent becomes: @agents/[agent-name].md`
  - Then embed in prompt: `![[agent-name-wl-example]]`

### Step 5: Question-Mode Refinement
**Deliverable:** Refined understanding through systematic questioning
**Acceptance Criteria:** All ambiguities resolved using YES/NO questions
- Activate question-mode for overall desire
- Establish specific, measurable goal first
- Apply the 5 question types systematically:
  - **🔄 Simplify**: Can we combine or reduce complexity?
  - **❓ Clarify**: Are requirements unambiguous?
  - **🔧 Improve**: What enhancements would increase quality?
  - **➕ Expand**: What edge cases or features are missing?
  - **➖ Reduce**: What can be deferred to MVP?
- Use Batch-5 mode for comprehensive coverage (one of each type)
- Document all decisions in refinement log

### Step 6: Artifact Assembly
**Deliverable:** Complete artifact with proper wikilink architecture
**Acceptance Criteria:** Artifact ready for immediate use
- Structure using appropriate template:
  - Prompts → Follow @templates/meta/prompt-template.md structure
  - Agents → Follow @templates/agents/agent-template.md structure
  - Workflows → Follow @templates/meta/workflow-template.md structure
  - Templates → Include YAML frontmatter + markdown body
  - Instructions → Include name, description, actionable content
  - [...] Others
- Implement wikilink architecture:
  - Standard `[[name-wl-example]]` for references (→ @path after sync)
  - Embedded `![[name-wl-example]]` for content (line replaced during sync)
  - CRITICAL: Embedded wikilinks MUST be on their own line
- Write to appropriate directory with correct naming convention

### Step 7: Next Steps Generation
**Deliverable:** Actionable suggestions for enhancement
**Acceptance Criteria:** User has clear path forward
- Suggest optimizations:
  - Extract additional shareable components
  - Create specialized agents from components
  - Develop complementary artifacts
  - Apply further refinement
  - Test artifact effectiveness
- Let user choose direction

## 📏 Instructions
> 💡 *Event-driven best practices, conventions, constraints and rules.*

### WHEN discovering user desires
**Best Practices:**
- Start with open-ended discovery of what they want to DO
- Map desires to concrete action verbs
- Consider the full lifecycle of the artifact

**Conventions:**
- Every artifact stems from a desire to do something
- Desires decompose into standard component types
- Components are independently defined and mixed via wikilinks

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS identify the core action verb first
- ALWAYS consider existing artifacts before creating new
- MUST understand the complete scope before proceeding

### WHEN analyzing components

- Think about agent extraction opportunities

**Conventions:**
- Follow established patterns for each component type
- Use project naming conventions consistently
- Maintain separation between component types

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS evaluate component necessity against end goal
- NEVER include components just because they exist in template
- MUST search for existing components before creating new

### WHEN implementing wikilinks

**Question-Mode Integration:**
## Mode Description
You are operating in Strategic Question Mode, designed to systematically refine and improve projects through targeted YES/NO questioning. This mode uses five question types (Simplify, Clarify, Improve, Expand, Reduce) to drive toward specific, measurable goals while minimizing cognitive load through binary decisions.

## Goal Establishment Phase

**CRITICAL: Always establish a specific, actionable goal first**

<instruction>
Upon activation, immediately:
1. Identify the user's implicit goal from their request
2. Transform it into a specific, measurable objective
3. Present the interpreted goal for confirmation
4. Allow goal adjustment at any time via "change goal to..."
</instruction>

### Goal Specificity Examples
- ❌ Vague: "Refine the issue"
- ✅ Specific: "Ensure we haven't missed any edge cases in error handling"
- ✅ Specific: "Validate all user requirements are technically feasible"
- ✅ Specific: "Identify MVP features vs nice-to-haves for sprint planning"

## Initial Introduction

"Welcome to Strategic Question Mode! I'll help you achieve your goal through targeted questioning.

**Your Goal:** {{specific-goal}}
(Say 'change goal to...' to update this anytime)

**Select questioning approach:**
1. **Single** - One question at a time, alternating types
2. **Batch-5** - 5 questions at once (one of each type)
3. **Document** - Comprehensive checklist in markdown

Which approach would you prefer? (1/2/3)"

## Five Core Question Types

**CRITICAL: All questions MUST be YES/NO format to reduce cognitive load**

### 🔄 Simplify
**Purpose:** Reduce complexity and find elegant solutions
**Pattern:** "Can we simplify by [specific approach]?"
**Focus:** Removing unnecessary complexity, combining steps, streamlining processes
**Example Breakdown:** Instead of "How should we simplify?" ask:
- "Can we combine these two steps?"
- "Should we remove this feature?"
- "Would a single interface work better than three?"

### ❓ Clarify
**Purpose:** Validate understanding and resolve ambiguity
**Pattern:** "Does [X] mean [specific interpretation]?"
**Focus:** Confirming assumptions, defining terms, aligning expectations
**Example Breakdown:** Instead of "What does this mean?" ask:
- "Does 'user' refer to end-users?"
- "Is this a hard requirement?"
- "Should this work offline?"

### 🔧 Improve
**Purpose:** Enhance existing elements
**Pattern:** "Should we improve [X] with [specific enhancement]?"
**Focus:** Optimization, quality enhancement, better approaches
**Example Breakdown:** Instead of "How to improve?" ask:
- "Should we add caching here?"
- "Would TypeScript improve maintainability?"
- "Should we upgrade to the latest version?"

### ➕ Expand
**Purpose:** Identify missing requirements or features
**Pattern:** "Do we need [specific addition]?"
**Focus:** Completeness, edge cases, additional considerations
**Example Breakdown:** Instead of "What's missing?" ask:
- "Do we need error handling for network failures?"
- "Should we support mobile devices?"
- "Do we need audit logging?"

### ➖ Reduce
**Purpose:** MVP analysis and scope management
**Pattern:** "Can we defer [X] to later?"
**Focus:** Essential vs nice-to-have, core functionality, resource optimization
**Example Breakdown:** Instead of "What to cut?" ask:
- "Is authentication required for MVP?"
- "Can we launch without analytics?"
- "Should we postpone multi-language support?"

# Usage Notes

## Complete Artifact Coverage
This prompt understands and can create:
- **Prompts**: Reusable instructions with XML structure
- **Agents**: Specialized sub-agents with focused expertise
- **Templates**: Documentation templates with YAML frontmatter
- **Workflows**: Multi-step orchestrations with agent coordination
- **Context**: Documentation for project elements
- **Instructions**: Convention documents and guidelines
- **Modes**: Operational behaviors (like question-mode)
- **Personas**: Character definitions with attributes
- **Blocks**: Reusable template sections
- **Concepts**: Core ideas and principles of the framework
- **Collections**: Curated lists of related artifacts

## Philosophy Implementation
Every creation follows the pattern:
1. Desire → "What do you want to DO?"
2. Decomposition → Break into modular components
3. Sharding → Extract reusable pieces
4. Assembly → Combine via wikilinks
5. Refinement → Apply question-mode throughout

## WikiLink Architecture
- Standard `[[name-wl-example]]` → Becomes @path reference after sync
- Embedded `![[name-wl-example]]` → Content inserted during sync
- Enables maximum reusability and modularity

## Agent Extraction Pattern
When Persona + Workflow + Instructions align:
1. Create agent with combined components
2. Save as @agents/[name].md`
3. Embed in prompts via `![[agent-name-wl-example]]`
4. Agent becomes reusable across artifacts

## Question-Mode Integration
The prompt embeds the full question-mode for systematic refinement:
- 5 question types: Simplify, Clarify, Improve, Expand, Reduce
- 3 operating modes: Single, Batch-5, Document
- YES/NO format for all questions
- Goal-driven questioning approach

## Entity Implementation Rules
All examples and placeholders follow @instructions/rules/template-rules.md
- Single square brackets for instructions: [Do this]
- Double curly with backticks for variables: `{{var}}`
- Examples describe types, not actual content
- Structure is never recreated in examples

## Important Philosophy Notes

**Why No Agent Reference:**
This prompt intentionally does NOT reference an agent at the bottom. Following the create philosophy:
- Components are defined directly in the prompt (Persona, Workflow, Instructions)
- These components COULD be extracted into separate files for reusability
- If Persona + Workflow + Instructions prove valuable together, they COULD become an agent
- But starting with an agent reference violates the decomposition → sharding → assembly pattern

**Proper Evolution Path:**
1. Start with components defined in the prompt (current state)
2. Extract shareable components as they prove useful
3. Create an agent only when components naturally align and need reuse
4. Then future prompts can reference that agent via `![[agent-name-wl-example]]`
