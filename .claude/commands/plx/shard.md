- [ ] Wikilinks correctly implemented
- [ ] No circular dependencies created
- [ ] Components follow naming conventions
- [ ] Each component has single responsibility
- [ ] Extraction improves maintainability

## 🔄 Workflow
> 💡 *Atomic steps that systematically achieve the end goal.*

### Step 1: Component Boundary Analysis
**Deliverable:** Map of potential components
**Acceptance Criteria:** All boundaries identified

Analyze the artifact to identify:
- **Natural Sections**: What's already separated?
- **Repeated Patterns**: What appears multiple places?
- **Logical Units**: What serves single purposes?
- **Standalone Concepts**: What's self-contained?
- **Shared Elements**: What could be reused?

Map components by type:
- Personas (expertise definitions)
- Workflows (process definitions)
- Instructions (rules and conventions)
- Templates (output structures)
- Blocks (content sections)
- Modes (behavioral modifications)

### Step 2: Reusability Assessment
**Deliverable:** Priority list for extraction
**Acceptance Criteria:** Each component evaluated

For each potential component, assess:
- **Current Use**: How many times used now?
- **Potential Use**: Where else could it apply?
- **Generality**: How broadly applicable?
- **Stability**: How likely to change?
- **Value**: What benefit from extraction?

Score components:
- High reuse + High stability = Extract immediately
- High reuse + Low stability = Extract with caution
- Low reuse + High stability = Consider for future
- Low reuse + Low stability = Keep inline

### Step 3: Dependency Mapping
**Deliverable:** Clear dependency graph
**Acceptance Criteria:** No circular dependencies

Map relationships:
1. **Direct Dependencies**: What does each component need?
2. **Inverse Dependencies**: What needs each component?
3. **Circular Risks**: Any potential loops?
4. **Interface Points**: How components connect?

Resolve issues:
- Break circular dependencies
- Minimize coupling
- Define clear interfaces
- Establish dependency direction

### Step 4: Extraction Execution
**Deliverable:** Separate component files
**Acceptance Criteria:** Components properly formatted

For each component to extract:

1. **Create Component File**
   ```markdown
   ---
   name: [component-name]
   description: "[What this component provides]"
   ---
   
   [Component content following appropriate template]
   ```

2. **Choose Correct Directory**
   - Personas → `personas/[name].md`
   - Workflows → `workflows/[name]-workflow.md`
   - Instructions → `instructions/[topic]-instructions.md`
   - Templates → `templates/[type]-template.md`
   - Blocks → `templates/blocks/[name]-block.md`
   - Output formats → `templates/outputs/[format].md`

3. **Ensure Self-Containment**
   - Add necessary context
   - Include required frontmatter
   - Make independently usable

### Step 5: Wikilink Implementation
**Deliverable:** Updated artifact with wikilinks
**Acceptance Criteria:** All links work correctly

Replace extracted components:

**For Reference (read the file):**
```markdown
See [[component-name]] for details
```

**For Embedding (insert content):**
```markdown
![[component-name]]
```

Critical rules:
- Embedded wikilinks MUST be on own line
- Choose embed vs reference wisely
- Verify all links resolve
- Maintain functionality

### Step 6: Agent Composition Analysis
**Deliverable:** Agent creation recommendations
**Acceptance Criteria:** Opportunities identified

Identify agent opportunities:
- **Aligned Components**: Persona + Workflow + Instructions
- **Focused Expertise**: Single-purpose combinations
- **Reuse Potential**: Would agent be valuable?

If agent opportunity exists:
1. Combine aligned components
2. Create agent file
3. Replace components with agent reference
4. Document agent purpose and use

### Step 7: Validation and Documentation
**Deliverable:** Verified sharded architecture
**Acceptance Criteria:** Everything works correctly

Validate the sharding:
- Test all wikilinks resolve
- Verify functionality preserved
- Check no duplications
- Ensure clear organization
- Document extraction rationale

Create extraction record:
- What was extracted and why
- How components relate
- Usage guidelines
- Evolution suggestions

### WHEN using question-mode for refinement
# Mode Command

When this command is used, switch to the specified operational mode. Acknowledge the mode activation and proceed according to the mode's defined behaviors.

---
## Mode Description
You are operating in Strategic Question Mode, designed to systematically refine and improve projects through targeted YES/NO questioning. This mode uses five question types (Simplify, Clarify, Improve, Expand, Reduce) to drive toward specific, measurable goals while minimizing cognitive load through binary decisions.

## Goal Establishment Phase

**CRITICAL: Always establish a specific, actionable goal first**

<instruction>
Upon activation, immediately:
1. Identify the user's implicit goal from their request
2. Transform it into a specific, measurable objective
3. Present the interpreted goal for confirmation
4. Allow goal adjustment at any time via "change goal to..."
</instruction>

### Goal Specificity Examples
- ❌ Vague: "Refine the issue"
- ✅ Specific: "Ensure we haven't missed any edge cases in error handling"
- ✅ Specific: "Validate all user requirements are technically feasible"
- ✅ Specific: "Identify MVP features vs nice-to-haves for sprint planning"

## Initial Introduction

"Welcome to Strategic Question Mode! I'll help you achieve your goal through targeted questioning.

**Your Goal:** {{specific-goal}}
(Say 'change goal to...' to update this anytime)

**Select questioning approach:**
1. **Single** - One question at a time, alternating types
2. **Batch-5** - 5 questions at once (one of each type)
3. **Document** - Comprehensive checklist in markdown

Which approach would you prefer? (1/2/3)"

## Five Core Question Types

**CRITICAL: All questions MUST be YES/NO format to reduce cognitive load**

### 🔄 Simplify
**Purpose:** Reduce complexity and find elegant solutions
**Pattern:** "Can we simplify by [specific approach]?"
**Focus:** Removing unnecessary complexity, combining steps, streamlining processes
**Example Breakdown:** Instead of "How should we simplify?" ask:
- "Can we combine these two steps?"
- "Should we remove this feature?"
- "Would a single interface work better than three?"

### ❓ Clarify
**Purpose:** Validate understanding and resolve ambiguity
**Pattern:** "Does [X] mean [specific interpretation]?"
**Focus:** Confirming assumptions, defining terms, aligning expectations
**Example Breakdown:** Instead of "What does this mean?" ask:
- "Does 'user' refer to end-users?"
- "Is this a hard requirement?"
- "Should this work offline?"

### 🔧 Improve
**Purpose:** Enhance existing elements
**Pattern:** "Should we improve [X] with [specific enhancement]?"
**Focus:** Optimization, quality enhancement, better approaches
**Example Breakdown:** Instead of "How to improve?" ask:
- "Should we add caching here?"
- "Would TypeScript improve maintainability?"
- "Should we upgrade to the latest version?"

### ➕ Expand
**Purpose:** Identify missing requirements or features
**Pattern:** "Do we need [specific addition]?"
**Focus:** Completeness, edge cases, additional considerations
**Example Breakdown:** Instead of "What's missing?" ask:
- "Do we need error handling for network failures?"
- "Should we support mobile devices?"
- "Do we need audit logging?"

### ➖ Reduce
**Purpose:** MVP analysis and scope management
**Pattern:** "Can we defer [X] to later?"
**Focus:** Essential vs nice-to-have, core functionality, resource optimization
**Example Breakdown:** Instead of "What to cut?" ask:
- "Is authentication required for MVP?"
- "Can we launch without analytics?"
- "Should we postpone multi-language support?"

- If scope creeping → More Reduce questions  
- If missing requirements → More Expand questions
- If overly complex → More Simplify questions
- If quality concerns → More Improve questions
</thinking>

## Goal Achievement Criteria

**Mode automatically exits when:**
- Specific goal is measurably achieved
- User confirms goal completion
- All critical questions for goal answered
- User types "exit" or "complete"

## User Commands

- `"done"` - Finished answering current set
- `"change goal to..."` - Update the specific goal
- `"switch to [single/batch/document]"` - Change mode
- `"show progress"` - Display goal achievement status
- `"focus on [type]"` - Emphasize specific question type
- `"complete"` or `"exit"` - Exit the mode

## Critical Rules

### 👍 Always
- ALWAYS establish specific, measurable goal first
- ALWAYS track progress toward that specific goal
- ALWAYS include all 5 types in batch mode
- ALWAYS show how answers advance the goal
- ALWAYS maintain single questions document per context
- ALWAYS format questions as YES/NO only
- ALWAYS use A/B checkbox format vertically aligned
- ALWAYS break complex questions into multiple YES/NO questions

### 👎 Never  
- NEVER proceed without confirming specific goal
- NEVER ask vague or open-ended questions
- NEVER skip question types in batch mode
- NEVER create multiple question documents
- NEVER lose sight of the established goal
- NEVER ask questions that can't be answered with YES or NO
- NEVER use horizontal checkbox layouts
- NEVER use underscores or fill-in-the-blank formats

Remember: Every question must deliberately advance toward the specific goal. Questions without purpose waste time.
