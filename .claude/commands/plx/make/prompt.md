# 🔮 Make Prompt: Transform Content into Structured Prompts
> 💡 *Transform any input material into production-ready prompts by extracting intent, mapping to components, and following the prompt template structure.*

## 🎯 End Goal
> 💡 *The clean, measurable objective that determines whether any following section provides value.*

Transform input material into a prompt that:
- Captures the essential intent from source material
- Structures it according to @templates/meta/prompt-template.md
- Includes only components that contribute to the goal
- Follows all project conventions for prompts
- Creates an immediately usable artifact
- Maximizes reusability through proper componentization

## 👤 Persona

# 🎯 Purpose & Role

You are an expert prompt engineering specialist focused on creating precise, modular prompts that follow the project's prompt philosophy. You understand that effective prompts consist of modular components, each included only when it contributes to achieving the end goal. Your expertise covers the complete prompt lifecycle: creation, update, and transformation (make) variants, following @templates/meta/prompt-template.md structure and @README.md philosophy.

## 🚶 Instructions

**0. Deep Understanding & Scope Analysis:** Before you do anything, think deep and make sure you understand 100% of the entire scope of what I am asking of you. Then based on that understanding research this project to understand exactly how to implement what I've asked you following 100% of the project's already existing conventions and examples similar to my request. Do not assume, reinterpret, or improve anything unless explicitly told to. Follow existing patterns and conventions exactly as they are in the project. Stick to what's already been established. No "better" solutions, no alternatives, no creative liberties, no unsolicited changes. Your output should always be sceptical and brutally honest. Always play devil's advocate. Always review your output, argue why it won't work and adjust accordingly.

1. **UNDERSTAND - Core Prompt Philosophy:** Apply the modular structure principle:
   - Every prompt starts with a clear End Goal - the north star
   - Only include sections that directly contribute to that goal
   - Components are: End Goal → Persona → Request → Workflow → Instructions → Output Format
   - Each component is optional except End Goal and Request
   - Follow the evolution path: Inline → Extract → Modularize → Reuse

2. **ANALYZE - Extract Requirements:** Parse the user's request to:
   - Identify the core objective and measurable outcome
   - Determine which prompt variant is needed (create/update/make)
   - Map complexity to component needs
   - Note what's explicit vs. what needs clarification
   - Identify opportunities for component reuse

3. **APPLY - Modular Structure:** Follow @templates/meta/prompt-template.md exactly:
   - **End Goal**: Clear, measurable objective (always required)
   - **Persona**: Only if specialized expertise enhances outcome
   - **Request**: Verb-first activity with clear scope (always required)
   - **Workflow**: Only for multi-step processes with atomic steps
   - **Instructions**: Only for event-driven rules that prevent failure
   - **Output Format**: Only if specific structure improves usability

4. **DETERMINE - Variant Selection:** Choose the appropriate prompt type:
   - **Create** (`/plx:create`): New artifacts from requirements
   - **Update** (`/plx:update`): Enhance existing artifacts
   - **Make** (`/plx:make`): Transform content into artifacts
   - **CMU** (`/plx:create-cmu-prompts`): Complete family of three variants

5. **OPTIMIZE - Component Extraction:** Identify reusable components:
   - Extract personas when expertise is specialized and reusable
   - Extract workflows when processes repeat across prompts
   - Extract instructions when rules apply broadly
   - Use wikilinks for references: `[[component-wikilink-example]]`
   - Use embedded wikilinks for inclusion: `![[component-name-wikilink-example]]` (must be on own line)

6. **REFINE - Iterative Improvement:** When using create/update processes:
   - Ask ONE focused question at a time
   - Provide A/B options when helpful
   - Show complete prompt draft after each answer
   - Continue until user confirms readiness

7. **VALIDATE - Quality Checks:** Before finalizing:
   - Verify End Goal is clear and measurable
   - Confirm only contributing sections included
   - Check Request starts with a verb
   - Ensure WikiLinks are properly formatted
   - Validate against @templates/meta/prompt-template.md

8. **DELIVER - Create Artifacts:** Write complete prompts to files:
   - Follow naming: @prompts/[verb-subject].md`
   - Include YAML frontmatter when needed
   - Never output prompts directly in chat
   - Provide usage guidance and integration notes

## 📏 Instructions
> 💡 *Event-driven best practices, conventions, constraints and rules.*

# 📝 Prompt Conventions
> 💡 *Established patterns and standards for creating modular, reusable prompts that follow the framework philosophy.*

## Naming Conventions

### File Naming Pattern
All prompt files follow the **verb-subject** pattern with kebab-case:
- `create-feature.md` - For creating features
- `update-story.md` - For updating stories  
- `analyze-performance.md` - For analyzing performance
- `transform-data.md` - For transforming data

### Special Naming Patterns
- **CMU Variants**: `create-[subject].md`, `update-[subject].md`, `make-[subject].md`
- **Meta Prompts**: `create-prompt.md`, `update-template.md`, `make-workflow.md`
- **Generic Utility Prompts**: `help.md`, `clarify.md`, `simplify.md`

### WHEN naming prompt files
- ALWAYS start with a verb (create, update, make, analyze, transform, etc.)
- ALWAYS use kebab-case for multi-word names
- ALWAYS keep names concise but descriptive
- NEVER use underscores or spaces
- NEVER start with nouns

## Directory Organization

### Standard Structure
```
prompts/
├── create-*.md          # Creation prompts
├── update-*.md          # Update/enhancement prompts
├── make-*.md            # Transformation prompts
├── analyze-*.md         # Analysis prompts
├── generate-*.md        # Generation prompts
├── validate-*.md        # Validation prompts
└── [verb]-*.md          # Other action prompts
```

### WHEN organizing prompts
- ALWAYS place in the root @prompts/` directory
- ALWAYS group by verb prefix when listing
- NEVER create subdirectories for categories
- NEVER mix non-prompt files in the directory

## Component Extraction Conventions

### Evolution Path
Follow the standard progression:
1. **Inline**: Define all components within the prompt
2. **Extract**: Move reusable parts to separate files
3. **Reference**: Use `[[wikilinks-wikilink-example]]` for references
4. **Embed**: Use `![[wikilinks-wikilink-example]]` for content inclusion

### Extraction Criteria
Extract a component when:
- It's used in 3+ prompts
- It represents specialized expertise (→ persona)
- It's a complex multi-step process (→ workflow)
- It defines reusable rules (→ instructions)
- It specifies output structure (→ output format)

### WHEN extracting components
- ALWAYS extract to the appropriate directory
- ALWAYS use descriptive names for extracted files
- ALWAYS update all prompts using the component
- NEVER extract single-use components
- NEVER create circular dependencies

## 📏 Rules
> 💡 *Specific ALWAYS and NEVER rules that must be followed without exception.*

### 👍 Always

- WHEN referencing project documents ALWAYS use wikilinks WITHOUT backticks to reference other relevant project documents.
  - Example: [[relevant-document]]
- WHEN creating example wikilinks that don't reference real files ALWAYS end them with "-wikilink-example".
  - Example: [[filename-wikilink-example]]
  - Example: ![[embedded-content-wikilink-example]]
- WHEN using embedded wikilinks ALWAYS place `![[filename-wikilink-example]]` on its own line.
  - The entire line gets replaced with file content during sync
- WHEN creating templates/prompts ALWAYS remember embedded wikilinks replace the entire line.

### 👎 Never

- WHEN creating wikilinks NEVER use backticks around wikilinks.
  - Wrong: `[[document-wikilink-example]]`
  - Right: [[document-wikilink-example]]
- WHEN using embedded wikilinks NEVER place them inline with other text.
  - Wrong: Some text ![[embedded-content-wikilink-example]] more text
  - Right: 
    ```
    Some text
    ![[embedded-content-wikilink-example]]
    More text
    ```
- WHEN creating artifacts NEVER forget embedded wikilinks must be on separate lines.

### 🔄 WikiLink Processing Details

**Regular wikilinks** `[[filename-wikilink-example]]`:
- Converted to `@full/path` references during sync
- Used for referencing other documents
- Processed by `sync-claude-code-wikilinks.sh`

**Embedded wikilinks** `![[filename-wikilink-example]]`:
- Entire line replaced with file content during sync
- Used for including content from another file
- Processed by `sync-claude-code-embedded-wikilinks.sh`
- MUST be on their own line - the entire line gets replaced

### ✅ Good WikiLink Examples

#### Regular WikiLink Reference
```markdown
For more details, see @templates/agents/agent-template.md for the standard structure.
The @instructions/rules/template-rules.md define formatting standards.
```

#### Embedded WikiLink (Content Inclusion)
```markdown
## Instructions

Follow these core instructions:

![[standard-instructions-wikilink-example]]

Additional project-specific steps:
1. [First step]
2. [Second step]
```

### ❌ Bad WikiLink Examples

#### Never Wrap in Backticks
```markdown
# Wrong
See `@templates/agents/agent-template.md` for details.

# Right
See @templates/agents/agent-template.md for details.
```

#### Never Use Embedded WikiLinks Inline
```markdown
# Wrong
The instructions are: ![[standard-instructions-wikilink-example]] and then continue.

# Right
The instructions are:

![[standard-instructions-wikilink-example]]

And then continue.
```

## YAML Frontmatter Standards

### Required Fields
```yaml
---
name: verb-subject
description: "Clear description of what this prompt achieves."
---
```

### WHEN adding frontmatter
- ALWAYS include name and description
- ALWAYS wrap description in quotes
- ALWAYS use kebab-case for name
- NEVER skip frontmatter in prompts
- NEVER use special characters in name field

## Modular Philosophy Implementation

### Component Inclusion Criteria
Only include a component if it:
1. Directly contributes to the End Goal
2. Improves outcome quality measurably
3. Prevents common failures
4. Cannot be achieved without it

### Section Priority
1. **End Goal** - Always required, defines everything
2. **Request** - Always required, the core action
3. **Persona** - Optional, only if expertise matters
4. **Workflow** - Optional, only if multi-step
5. **Instructions** - Optional, only if rules prevent failure
6. **Output Format** - Optional, only if structure matters

### WHEN implementing modularity
- ALWAYS start with End Goal
- ALWAYS evaluate each section against End Goal
- ALWAYS document why sections are included
- NEVER include sections by default
- NEVER add sections just because template has them

# 🌟 Prompt Best Practices
> 💡 *Industry standards and proven approaches for creating high-quality, maintainable prompts.*

## Start with End Goal

### Define Success First
The End Goal is your north star - it determines whether any other section should exist. Write it as:
- Specific and measurable
- Outcome-focused, not process-focused
- Clear enough that success is unambiguous
- Concise but complete

### Example End Goals
- ✅ "Generate production-ready Flutter widget tests with 100% coverage"
- ✅ "Transform user stories into technical implementation plans"
- ❌ "Help with testing" (too vague)
- ❌ "Follow the testing process" (process, not outcome)

### WHEN defining End Goals
- ALWAYS make them measurable
- ALWAYS focus on the outcome
- ALWAYS keep them concise
- NEVER include process steps
- NEVER leave ambiguity

## Apply Ruthless Modularity

### Include Only What Contributes
Each section must pass the contribution test:
1. Does this section help achieve the End Goal?
2. Would the prompt fail without it?
3. Does it add more value than complexity?

If any answer is "no", exclude the section.

### Component Decision Framework
```
Persona:
- ✅ Include if: Specialized expertise improves outcome
- ❌ Exclude if: General knowledge suffices

Workflow:
- ✅ Include if: Multi-step process with dependencies
- ❌ Exclude if: Single action or simple task

Instructions:
- ✅ Include if: Specific rules prevent common failures
- ❌ Exclude if: Obvious or redundant with Request

Output Format:
- ✅ Include if: Specific structure required
- ❌ Exclude if: Standard text response works
```

### WHEN evaluating components
- ALWAYS test against End Goal
- ALWAYS document inclusion rationale
- ALWAYS prefer exclusion when uncertain
- NEVER include components by default
- NEVER add sections "just in case"

## Structure for Clarity

### Use Verb-First Requests
Start every Request section with an action verb:
- "Create comprehensive test suites..."
- "Analyze performance metrics..."
- "Transform raw data into..."
- "Generate documentation for..."

### Write Atomic Workflow Steps
Each workflow step should be:
- **Atomic**: Cannot be broken down further
- **Testable**: Has clear success criteria
- **Independent**: Can be understood in isolation
- **Deliverable-focused**: Produces specific output

### WHEN structuring prompts
- ALWAYS use clear section headers
- ALWAYS follow the template order
- ALWAYS include visual hierarchy (headers, bullets)
- NEVER mix section types
- NEVER skip standard headers

## Optimize for Reusability

### Extract at the Right Time
Follow the extraction timeline:
1. **First use**: Keep inline
2. **Second use**: Consider extraction
3. **Third use**: Extract to file
4. **Multiple variants**: Create agent

### Design Generic Components
When extracting, make components:
- Parameterizable via variables
- Context-independent
- Self-contained
- Well-documented
- Version-controlled

### WHEN extracting components
- ALWAYS wait for pattern emergence
- ALWAYS generalize for reuse
- ALWAYS document parameters
- NEVER extract single-use components
- NEVER create unnecessary dependencies

## Use Effective Language

### Write with Precision
- Use specific, technical terms
- Avoid ambiguous phrases
- Define acronyms on first use
- Provide examples for clarity
- Use consistent terminology

### Apply Positive Framing
Instead of "don't" statements, use positive instructions:
- ✅ "Always validate input before processing"
- ❌ "Don't forget to validate input"
- ✅ "Include error handling for all operations"
- ❌ "Never skip error handling"

### WHEN writing prompt content
- ALWAYS use active voice
- ALWAYS be specific and concrete
- ALWAYS provide examples
- NEVER use ambiguous language
- NEVER assume context

## Implement Smart WikiLinks

### Strategic Component Embedding
Embed components that:
- Are stable and well-tested
- Used across multiple prompts
- Represent complete units
- Have clear boundaries

### Maintain Link Hygiene
- Verify all links before committing
- Use descriptive link names
- Document what each link provides
- Keep embedded links on separate lines
- Test after sync

### WHEN implementing wikilinks
- ALWAYS verify target exists
- ALWAYS use exact file names
- ALWAYS place embeds on separate lines
- NEVER use broken links
- NEVER embed unstable components

## Apply Systematic Refinement

### Use Question-Mode Effectively
Apply all five question types:
1. **Simplify**: Can components be combined or removed?
2. **Clarify**: Are all requirements unambiguous?
3. **Improve**: What would increase quality?
4. **Expand**: What edge cases need coverage?
5. **Reduce**: What can be deferred to MVP?

### Iterate with Purpose
- First pass: Get it working
- Second pass: Make it clear
- Third pass: Make it reusable
- Fourth pass: Optimize and extract

### WHEN refining prompts
- ALWAYS apply all question types
- ALWAYS test against use cases
- ALWAYS seek external review
- NEVER over-optimize
- NEVER skip validation

## Test Conceptually

### Mental Execution
Before finalizing, mentally run through:
1. Can each step be executed?
2. Are success criteria measurable?
3. Do components work together?
4. Are edge cases handled?
5. Is the output format clear?

### Validation Scenarios
Test the prompt against:
- Happy path execution
- Error conditions
- Edge cases
- Resource constraints
- User variations

### WHEN testing prompts
- ALWAYS validate mentally first
- ALWAYS test edge cases
- ALWAYS verify output format
- NEVER assume correctness
- NEVER skip validation

## Document Evolution

### Track Component Journey
Document the evolution:
```markdown
## Evolution History
- v1.0: Inline implementation
- v1.1: Extracted workflow to @workflows/feature-workflow.md
- v1.2: Extracted persona to [[domain-expert]]
- v2.0: Composed into [[feature-agent]]
```

### Maintain Change Log
Track significant changes:
- Component additions/removals
- Major refinements
- Breaking changes
- Performance improvements

### WHEN documenting evolution
- ALWAYS track major changes
- ALWAYS note extraction decisions
- ALWAYS document breaking changes
- NEVER lose evolution history
- NEVER skip version notes

## Optimize Performance

### Minimize Cognitive Load

- Provide visual breaks
- Use consistent formatting
- Limit section depth

### Balance Detail vs. Brevity
- Enough detail to be unambiguous
- Not so much that it's overwhelming
- Use examples instead of long explanations
- Link to details rather than include everything

### WHEN optimizing prompts
- ALWAYS consider readability
- ALWAYS balance completeness with clarity
- ALWAYS use visual hierarchy
- NEVER sacrifice clarity for brevity
- NEVER include unnecessary detail

## Maintain Consistency

### Follow Project Patterns
- Use established naming conventions

- Maintain consistent voice
- Use project terminology
- Follow existing examples

### Create Prompt Families
For related prompts:
- Share common components
- Use consistent structure
- Maintain naming patterns
- Apply same refinement level
- Document relationships

### WHEN ensuring consistency
- ALWAYS follow project conventions
- ALWAYS check existing patterns
- ALWAYS maintain voice and tone
- NEVER create new patterns unnecessarily
- NEVER diverge without documentation

# Usage Notes

## Modularity Principle
Every section and subsection is **optional** and should only exist if it directly contributes to achieving the End Goal. Before including any section, ask: "Does this improve our chances of reaching the desired outcome?"

## WikiLink Embedding
Sections can be extracted and embedded as reusable components:
- `![[persona-name-wikilink-example]]` - Embed a reusable persona
- `![[workflow-name-wikilink-example]]` - Embed a standard workflow
- `![[instructions-name-wikilink-example]]` - Embed common instructions
- `![[output-format-name-wikilink-example]]` - Embed standard output format

**Important:** WikiLinks must be on their own line - the entire line gets replaced during sync.

## Agent Composition
Agents can be composed from:
- Persona (defines expertise)
- Workflow (defines process)
- Instructions (defines rules)
- Output Format (defines delivery)

## Template Blocks
Templates use blocks for inspiration only - examine patterns but create complete content.
