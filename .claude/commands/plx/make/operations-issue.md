# 🏗️ Make Operations Issue: Transform Content Into Process Improvements
> 💡 *Convert operational discussions, process documentation, or efficiency reports into actionable improvement issues.*

## 🎯 End Goal
Transform input content into a complete operations issue that:
- Captures process inefficiencies from source material
- Maps current vs desired state clearly
- Identifies concrete improvement opportunities
- Establishes measurable success criteria
- Follows @templates/business/operations-issue-template.md structure

## 📋 Request
Transform operational content into an issue by:
1. Extracting process problems and inefficiencies
2. Identifying stakeholders and resources
3. Mapping current vs desired workflows
4. Defining improvement deliverables
5. Creating success metrics
6. Structuring per operations template

### Deliverables
- Complete operations issue document
- Process flow mapping
- Resource requirement analysis
- Implementation phases
- Success metrics

## 🔄 Workflow

### Step 1: Content Analysis
Analyze source for:
- **Process Problems**: What's not working?
- **Inefficiencies**: Where's time/money wasted?
- **Volume/Frequency**: How often, how much?
- **Stakeholders**: Who's affected?
- **Current Tools**: What's being used?
- **Desired Outcomes**: What's the goal?

### Step 2: Process Mapping
Transform descriptions into flows:
- Current state step-by-step
- Bottleneck identification
- Time per step
- Resource usage
- Desired state vision

### Step 3: Improvement Identification
Extract from content:
- Quick wins possible
- Major changes needed
- Resource requirements
- Training needs
- Risk factors

### Step 4: Success Metrics
Generate measurable criteria:
- Time savings targets
- Cost reduction goals
- Quality improvements
- Efficiency gains
- ROI calculations

### Step 5: Phase Planning
Structure implementation:
- Immediate improvements
- Short-term changes
- Long-term optimization
- Dependencies
- Rollback plans
