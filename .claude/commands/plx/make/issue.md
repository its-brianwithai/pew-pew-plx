## 🔄 Workflow
> 💡 *Atomic steps that systematically achieve the end goal.*

### Step 1: Content Analysis
**Deliverable:** Parsed understanding of source
**Acceptance Criteria:** All elements identified

Analyze source content for:
- **Stated Requirements**: What's explicitly mentioned?
- **Implied Requirements**: What's assumed or implied?
- **Actors**: Who/what is involved?
- **Actions**: What happens or should happen?
- **Goals**: What outcomes are desired?
- **Constraints**: What limitations exist?
- **Context**: What background is relevant?

Document findings:
```markdown
## Extraction Map
- Requirement: "[Source text]" → [Formal requirement]
- Actor: "[Context]" → [Identified actor]
- Flow: "[Description]" → [Event sequence]
- Goal: "[Desired outcome]" → [Acceptance criterion]
```

### Step 2: Requirement Formalization
**Deliverable:** Formal requirements list
**Acceptance Criteria:** All requirements captured

Transform extracted elements:
1. **From Informal to Formal**
   - "It would be nice if users could..." → "**User** should be able to..."
   - "We need better performance" → "**System** should respond in < 200ms"
   - "Make it work offline" → "**Application** should cache data for offline use"

2. **Fill Missing Details**
   - Add actors where implied
   - Specify conditions where vague
   - Include error cases

3. **Structure Requirements**
   - Group by actor
   - Order by priority
   - Number for reference

### Step 3: Actor Flow Construction
**Deliverable:** Complete event sequences
**Acceptance Criteria:** Logical flow established

Build flows from content:
1. **Identify Interactions**
   - Who initiates what?
   - What triggers events?
   - How do actors respond?

2. **Sequence Events**
   - Chronological order
   - Cause and effect chains
   - Parallel processes

3. **Add Data Flows**
   - What information moves?
   - What format/structure?
   - What validation needed?

Example transformation:
```
Source: "User uploads a file, we process it, then show results"
→
1. **User** → selects → file
   - Data: File object (max 10MB)
2. **User** → uploads → file
   - Data: Multipart form data
3. **System** → validates → file
   - Data: File type, size, content
4. **System** → processes → file
   - Data: Extracted content
5. **System** → displays → results
   - Data: Processed output
```

### Step 4: Deliverable Inference
**Deliverable:** CRUD operations mapped
**Acceptance Criteria:** All events have deliverables

Infer deliverables from requirements:
1. **Analyze Each Event**
   - What needs to exist?
   - What changes?
   - What gets consumed?

2. **Map to CRUD**
   - Create: What's new?
   - Read: What's accessed?
   - Update: What's modified?
   - Delete: What's removed?

3. **Identify Components**
   - Database operations
   - File system changes
   - API calls
   - UI updates

### Step 5: Acceptance Criteria Generation
**Deliverable:** Comprehensive test conditions
**Acceptance Criteria:** All scenarios covered

Generate criteria from goals:
1. **Success Conditions**
   - From: "Should work properly"
   - To: "✓ File uploads successfully"
        "✓ Processing completes < 5 seconds"
        "✓ Results display accurately"

2. **Failure Prevention**
   - From: "Don't lose data"
   - To: "✓ No data loss on network failure"
        "✓ No corruption during processing"

3. **Invariants**
   - From: "Keep it secure"
   - To: "✓ Only authenticated users can upload"
        "✓ Files are virus-scanned"

4. **Prohibitions**
   - From: "Prevent abuse"
   - To: "✓ No files > 10MB accepted"
        "✓ No executable files allowed"

### Step 6: Checkpoint Extraction
**Deliverable:** Implementation milestones identified
**Acceptance Criteria:** Natural PR/commit points found

Extract checkpoints from content:
1. **Identify Natural Breaks**
   - Look for "first", "then", "after that" language
   - Find independent functionality
   - Spot foundation vs enhancement

2. **Map to Progressive Milestones**
   - Checkpoint 1: Minimum viable piece
   - Checkpoint 2: Core functionality
   - Checkpoint 3: Polish and edge cases

3. **Assign Events and Deliverables**
   - Which events belong to each checkpoint?
   - What deliverables for each?
   - Can it ship independently?

### Step 7: Gap Identification
**Deliverable:** List of clarifications needed
**Acceptance Criteria:** All gaps documented

Identify what's missing:
- Unspecified actors
- Incomplete flows
- Missing error handling
- Undefined data formats
- Absent performance requirements
- Unclear boundaries

Mark with placeholders:
```markdown
[TODO: Confirm max file size]
[TODO: Specify supported file types]
[TODO: Define error message format]
```

### Step 8: Issue Assembly
**Deliverable:** Complete issue document
**Acceptance Criteria:** Template followed exactly

Assemble into @.claude/commands/use/issue-template.md:
1. Add appropriate emoji and title
2. Write brief description
3. Populate all sections
4. Add mermaid diagrams
5. Format acceptance criteria as checklists
6. Add implementation checkpoints
7. Include clarification needs

### WHEN using question-mode for refinement
# Mode Command

When this command is used, switch to the specified operational mode. Acknowledge the mode activation and proceed according to the mode's defined behaviors.

---
## Mode Description
You are operating in Strategic Question Mode, designed to systematically refine and improve projects through targeted YES/NO questioning. This mode uses five question types (Simplify, Clarify, Improve, Expand, Reduce) to drive toward specific, measurable goals while minimizing cognitive load through binary decisions.

## Goal Establishment Phase

**CRITICAL: Always establish a specific, actionable goal first**

<instruction>
Upon activation, immediately:
1. Identify the user's implicit goal from their request
2. Transform it into a specific, measurable objective
3. Present the interpreted goal for confirmation
4. Allow goal adjustment at any time via "change goal to..."
</instruction>

### Goal Specificity Examples
- ❌ Vague: "Refine the issue"
- ✅ Specific: "Ensure we haven't missed any edge cases in error handling"
- ✅ Specific: "Validate all user requirements are technically feasible"
- ✅ Specific: "Identify MVP features vs nice-to-haves for sprint planning"

## Initial Introduction

"Welcome to Strategic Question Mode! I'll help you achieve your goal through targeted questioning.

**Your Goal:** {{specific-goal}}
(Say 'change goal to...' to update this anytime)

**Select questioning approach:**
1. **Single** - One question at a time, alternating types
2. **Batch-5** - 5 questions at once (one of each type)
3. **Document** - Comprehensive checklist in markdown

Which approach would you prefer? (1/2/3)"

## Five Core Question Types

**CRITICAL: All questions MUST be YES/NO format to reduce cognitive load**

### 🔄 Simplify
**Purpose:** Reduce complexity and find elegant solutions
**Pattern:** "Can we simplify by [specific approach]?"
**Focus:** Removing unnecessary complexity, combining steps, streamlining processes
**Example Breakdown:** Instead of "How should we simplify?" ask:
- "Can we combine these two steps?"
- "Should we remove this feature?"
- "Would a single interface work better than three?"

### ❓ Clarify
**Purpose:** Validate understanding and resolve ambiguity
**Pattern:** "Does [X] mean [specific interpretation]?"
**Focus:** Confirming assumptions, defining terms, aligning expectations
**Example Breakdown:** Instead of "What does this mean?" ask:
- "Does 'user' refer to end-users?"
- "Is this a hard requirement?"
- "Should this work offline?"

### 🔧 Improve
**Purpose:** Enhance existing elements
**Pattern:** "Should we improve [X] with [specific enhancement]?"
**Focus:** Optimization, quality enhancement, better approaches
**Example Breakdown:** Instead of "How to improve?" ask:
- "Should we add caching here?"
- "Would TypeScript improve maintainability?"
- "Should we upgrade to the latest version?"

### ➕ Expand
**Purpose:** Identify missing requirements or features
**Pattern:** "Do we need [specific addition]?"
**Focus:** Completeness, edge cases, additional considerations
**Example Breakdown:** Instead of "What's missing?" ask:
- "Do we need error handling for network failures?"
- "Should we support mobile devices?"
- "Do we need audit logging?"

### ➖ Reduce
**Purpose:** MVP analysis and scope management
**Pattern:** "Can we defer [X] to later?"
**Focus:** Essential vs nice-to-have, core functionality, resource optimization
**Example Breakdown:** Instead of "What to cut?" ask:
- "Is authentication required for MVP?"
- "Can we launch without analytics?"
- "Should we postpone multi-language support?"

- If missing requirements → More Expand questions
- If overly complex → More Simplify questions
- If quality concerns → More Improve questions
</thinking>

## Goal Achievement Criteria

**Mode automatically exits when:**
- Specific goal is measurably achieved
- User confirms goal completion
- All critical questions for goal answered
- User types "exit" or "complete"

## User Commands

- `"done"` - Finished answering current set
- `"change goal to..."` - Update the specific goal
- `"switch to [single/batch/document]"` - Change mode
- `"show progress"` - Display goal achievement status
- `"focus on [type]"` - Emphasize specific question type
- `"complete"` or `"exit"` - Exit the mode

## Critical Rules

### 👍 Always
- ALWAYS establish specific, measurable goal first
- ALWAYS track progress toward that specific goal
- ALWAYS include all 5 types in batch mode
- ALWAYS show how answers advance the goal
- ALWAYS maintain single questions document per context
- ALWAYS format questions as YES/NO only
- ALWAYS use A/B checkbox format vertically aligned
- ALWAYS break complex questions into multiple YES/NO questions

### 👎 Never  
- NEVER proceed without confirming specific goal
- NEVER ask vague or open-ended questions
- NEVER skip question types in batch mode
- NEVER create multiple question documents
- NEVER lose sight of the established goal
- NEVER ask questions that can't be answered with YES or NO
- NEVER use horizontal checkbox layouts
- NEVER use underscores or fill-in-the-blank formats

Remember: Every question must deliberately advance toward the specific goal. Questions without purpose waste time.
