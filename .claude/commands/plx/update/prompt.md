### Core Components

#### 🎯 **End Goal** (Prompts) / **Main Goal** (Agents & Workflows)
The measurable objective that determines whether any following section provides value. This is your north star - every component should improve your chances of achieving this goal exactly as intended.

- **Prompts** define **End Goal**: Achievement-focused objective
- **Agents** define **Main Goal**: Behavioral-focused objective
- **Workflows** define **Main Goal**: Process-focused objective

**Required subsections:**
- **Deliverables**: What must be produced or accomplished
- **Acceptance Criteria**: How to verify the goal has been achieved

Every section and component must align with and contribute to these goals to ensure clear, measurable success.

#### 👤 **Persona** (Optional)
Specialized expertise attributes included when they enhance outcomes:
- Role, Expertise, Domain, Knowledge
- Experience, Skills, Abilities, Responsibilities
- Interests, Background, Preferences, Perspective
- Communication Style

**Claude Command:** `/act:<persona-name>` - Activate this persona directly
**In Files:** `[[persona-name-wl-example]]` to reference, `![[persona-name-wl-example]]` to embed content

#### 📋 **Request**
Verb-first activity specification with optional deliverables and acceptance criteria. Always starts with an action: Create, Update, Analyze, Transform, etc.

#### 🔄 **Workflow** (Optional)
Multi-phase processes with clear deliverables and acceptance criteria. Each workflow must define its main goal, and every phase must specify what it delivers and how to verify success.

**Key Elements:**
- Main Goal with success criteria
- Phases with deliverables and acceptance criteria
- Steps with purpose and instructions
- Quality gates and decision points

**Claude Command:** `/start:<workflow-name>` - Launch this workflow
**In Files:** `[[workflow-name-wl-example]]` to reference, `![[workflow-name-wl-example]]` to embed content

#### 📏 **Instructions** (Optional)
Event‑driven guidance following the pattern: "When {scenario} occurs, then {apply these instructions}".

Instruction categories and naming rules:
- Type → suffix → folder
    - Conventions → `-conventions.md` → @instructions/conventions/`
    - Best practices → `-best-practices.md` → @instructions/best-practices/`
    - Rules (always/never) → `-rules.md` → @instructions/rules/`
    - Tool-specific instructions (e.g., Maestro) → `-instructions.md` → @instructions/<tool>/` (e.g., @instructions/maestro/`)

4‑step rule for any new instruction:
1) Read existing docs to avoid duplication
2) Determine the type (convention | best‑practice | rule | tool‑instructions)
3) Rename file to match suffix exactly
4) Place in the correct folder under @instructions/`

**Claude Command:** `/apply:<instruction-name>` - Apply these instructions
**In Files:** `[[instruction-name-wl-example]]` to reference, `![[instruction-name-wl-example]]` to embed content

#### 📊 **Output Format** (Optional)
Specifications for how deliverables should be structured - templates, format types (JSON, YAML, Markdown), or specific structural requirements.

**Claude Command:** `/output:<format-name>` - Apply this output format
**In Files:** `[[format-name-wl-example]]` to reference, `![[format-name-wl-example]]` to embed content

### The Modular Approach

Each component can and should be extracted and referenced via wikilinks when it can be reused. During sync:
- `[[wikilinks-wl-example]]` are transformed to `@path/to/file.md` for dynamic loading by Claude
- `![[embedded-wikilinks-wl-example]]` are replaced with the actual file content inline

⚠️ **Important:** The `@path/to/file.md` references inside command files auto-load when you use slash commands (e.g., `/use:template-file` will automatically read all `@` references inside that template). However, if you just type `@template-file` directly in chat, Claude only sees the path - no automatic reading occurs.

### 🎩 A Good Agent

When certain prompt components naturally align around a common purpose and main goal, they can be composed into agents. Benefits:
- Use as **sub-agents** for specific tasks within larger workflows
- Activate directly via **`/act:<agent-name>`** commands
- **Reusable expertise** across all your prompts and projects

### Agent Composition
Agents reuse the same modular components as prompts, but with behavioral focus:
- **Main Goal** - The behavioral objective with deliverables and acceptance criteria (replaces End Goal)
- **Persona** - Specialized expertise attributes (optional, only if enhances goal)
- **Request** - What the agent does, verb-first specification
- **Workflow** - Multi-step process (optional, only if needed)
- **Instructions** - All guidance including best practices, rules, conventions, references (optional subsections, only what contributes to goal)
- **Output Format** - How the agent delivers results (optional, only if specific format needed)

# 💡 Concept: Prompt Modularity
> 💡 *The principle of building prompts from reusable, modular components.*

The modular prompt philosophy is central to this project. Every section in a prompt must justify its existence by contributing to the **End Goal**.

The evolution path for components is:
1.  **Inline**: Start with all content inside a single prompt.
2.  **Extract**: Identify a reusable pattern and move it to its own file (e.g., a block, persona, or workflow).
3.  **Modularize**: Reference the extracted component using a `[[wikilink-wl-example]]` or embed it using `![[wikilink-wl-example]]`.
4.  **Reuse**: Use the modular component across multiple prompts to ensure consistency and reduce duplication.

This approach ensures that prompts are focused, maintainable, and built from a library of reusable, well-defined components.

# 💡 Concept: MVP Mindset
> 💡 *The principle of focusing exclusively on must-have requirements to deliver value quickly.*

The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) mindset always focuses on the **must-haves**. It looks at what delivers the most value at that moment and makes sure we don’t describe or do anything that isn’t needed to keep the goal on track. The must-haves are what we’re working toward.

# 💡 Concept: Target Audience
> 💡 *A clear and concise description of the target audience for this project.*

[This document is in pew-pew state. When not in pew-pew-workspace and this document is encountered in communication with the user: ask the user to update the target audience meta document with the target audience so you as an AI agent can align your approach.]

```
<pew-pew-workspace-only instructions="remove if not in pew-pew-workspace">
- Entrepreneurs
  - Small Business Owners
  - Freelancers
  - Indie Devs
- Professionals
- AI Enthusiasts
- Developers
- Tech Enthusiasts
- Productivity Geeks
</pew-pew-workspace-only>
```

# 💡 Concept: Meta-Concepts
> 💡 *The distinction between the framework's input documents (meta-concepts) and the output documents they generate.*

The PLX framework consists of two types of documents: **input documents** and **output documents**.

**Input documents** are the core components of the framework itself. We use these to create output. They include:
- **Prompts** (@prompts/`): Verb-subject naming, XML structuring, chain-of-thought
- **Agents** (@agents/`): Focused expertise, tool restrictions, YAML frontmatter
- **Templates** (@templates/`): YAML frontmatter, structured markdown, blocks
- **Workflows** (@workflows/`): Multi-phase orchestration, decision logic, quality gates
- **Context** (`meta/`): Documentation for actors, components, platforms, roles, teams
- **Instructions** (@instructions/`): Event-driven conventions, guidelines, best practices
- **Modes** (@modes/`): Operational behaviors that change interaction patterns
- **Personas** (@personas/`): Character definitions with expertise attributes
- **Blocks** (@templates/blocks/`): Reusable content sections
- **Concepts** (@concepts/`): Core ideas and principles of the framework
- **Collections** (@collections/`): Curated lists of related artifacts

We consider these input documents to be **meta-concepts**. Meta agents operate on these documents. When we talk about meta-templates or meta-documents, we mean documents and concepts that can be created within the framework and used to generate output.

**Output documents** are the artifacts that users of this framework create using the input documents. For example, a user might use the `create-issue` prompt (an input document) to generate a new tech issue (an output document).

## 📏 Rules
> 💡 *Specific ALWAYS and NEVER rules that must be followed without exception.*

### 👍 Always

- WHEN placing instruction placeholders ALWAYS use single square brackets for placeholder instructions.
  - Example: [Replace this with actual content]
- WHEN creating template variables ALWAYS use double curly brackets WITH backticks to indicate template variables.
    - Example: `{{variable-name}}`
- WHEN referencing parts of the document ALWAYS use template variables.
  - Example: Follow instruction in `{{variable-name}}` when [some condition].
- WHEN demonstrating examples ALWAYS put them inside an example tag inside a codeblock.
    - Example: See `{{example}}`
- WHEN creating examples ALWAYS describe the example types instead of actual examples.
    - Example: See `{{example}}`
- WHEN creating examples that need multiple items ALWAYS describe ALL types on ONE line (e.g., "architectural decisions, limitations, dependencies, performance considerations").
    - Example: See `{{multiple-items-example}}`
- WHEN examples require specific structure (like steps with substeps) ALWAYS show the exact structure with inline [placeholder] instructions while keeping type descriptions on single lines.
    - Example: See `{{structured-example}}`
- WHEN creating examples for structured content (like nested lists, hierarchies, or multi-level content) NEVER show the structure - ONLY describe what types go there in a single line.
- WHEN an example has complex formatting IGNORE the formatting and ONLY list the content types.

### 👎 Never

- WHEN creating examples NEVER use actual content, only describe the types of examples.
- WHEN creating examples NEVER use multiple lines for the example types.

### 🚫 Example Structure Rule
NEVER recreate the structure of what you're documenting in the example. The example should ONLY contain:
1. First line: [Description of all the types that go in this section]
2. Second line: [Additional items if needed]  
3. Third line: [...]

Even if the actual content has bullets, sub-bullets, multiple levels, categories, etc - IGNORE ALL OF THAT in the example.

### ✅ Good Examples

#### Basic Example
`{{example}}`:
```
<example>
- [Describe the example types]
- [More examples if needed]
- [...]
</example>
```

#### Multiple Items Example
`{{multiple-items-example}}`:
```
<example>
- [Architectural decision types, limitation types, dependency types, performance consideration types, and any other relevant context types]
- [Additional collections of related types if needed]
- [...]
</example>
```

#### Structured Example
`{{structured-example}}`:
```
<example>
1. [First action type]: [Description of what this action does]
   - [Sub-step type if the structure requires it]
   - [Another sub-step type]
2. [Second action type]: [Description of this action]
3. [More action types as needed]
[...]
</example>
```

## 📏 Wikilink Rules
> 💡 *Specific ALWAYS and NEVER rules that must be followed without exception.*

### 👍 Always

- WHEN referencing project documents ALWAYS use wikilinks WITHOUT backticks to reference other relevant project documents.
  - Example: [[relevant-document-wl-example]]
- WHEN creating example wikilinks that don't reference real files ALWAYS end them with "-wl-example".
  - Example: [[filename-wl-example]]
  - Example: ![[embedded-content-wl-example]]
- WHEN using embedded wikilinks ALWAYS place `![[filename-wl-example]]` on its own line.
  - The entire line gets replaced with file content during sync
- WHEN creating templates/prompts ALWAYS remember embedded wikilinks replace the entire line.

### 👎 Never

- WHEN creating wikilinks NEVER use backticks around wikilinks.
  - Wrong: `[[document-wl-example]]`
  - Right: [[document-wl-example]]
- WHEN using embedded wikilinks NEVER place them inline with other text.
  - Wrong: Some text ![[embedded-content-wl-example]] more text
  - Right: 
    ```
    Some text
    ![[embedded-content-wl-example]]
    More text
    ```
- WHEN creating artifacts NEVER forget embedded wikilinks must be on separate lines.

### 🔄 WikiLink Processing Details

**Regular wikilinks** `[[filename-wl-example]]`:
- Converted to `@full/path` references during sync
- Used for referencing other documents
- Processed by `sync-claude-code-wikilinks.sh`

**Embedded wikilinks** `![[filename-wl-example]]`:
- Entire line replaced with file content during sync
- Used for including content from another file
- Processed by `sync-claude-code-embedded-wikilinks.sh`
- MUST be on their own line - the entire line gets replaced

### ✅ Good WikiLink Examples

```

# 💡 Concept: Context Rot Awareness
> 💡 *The principle of including only value-adding, non-redundant information in documents to maintain a clean context for AI agents.*

Context Rot Awareness is about making sure that everything in a document—whether it’s a prompt, an agent, an instruction, or a concept doc—adds value to the main goal we’re working toward with that document. If it doesn’t, it shouldn’t be in there.

Also, don’t repeat things. For example, if you explain a rule and say something must **always** happen, you don’t need to also say the opposite must **never** happen. Saying it once is enough.

We do this mainly to prevent agents from getting useless info and to avoid wasting tokens on information that’s already known or irrelevant.

# 💡 Concept: Scope Integrity
> 💡 *The principle of creating exactly what was requested - nothing more, nothing less - based solely on explicit requirements and existing project patterns.*

Scope Integrity ensures that agents maintain absolute fidelity to the user's request without making assumptions, adding unrequested features, or applying "improvements" that weren't explicitly asked for. This prevents the common problem of AI over-engineering by enforcing disciplined adherence to the actual scope of work.

## Core Requirements

**Deep Understanding First:** Before taking any action, agents must fully comprehend 100% of the request scope. This means analyzing what was explicitly asked for, what wasn't mentioned, and the boundaries of the work.

**Project Research:** Agents must thoroughly research existing project conventions, patterns, and examples similar to the request. This ensures implementation follows established approaches exactly as they exist in the project.

**Exact Replication:** When following existing patterns, agents must replicate them precisely. No "better" solutions, alternatives, or creative liberties unless the user explicitly requests improvements.

## What This Prevents

- Adding features or information not explicitly requested
- Making assumptions about what the user "probably" wants
- Applying personal preferences or "best practices" not established in the project
- Over-engineering solutions beyond the stated requirements
- Reinterpreting requests to fit preconceived notions
- Including "helpful" additions that weren't asked for

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Parse the Request:** Identify exactly what action was requested and what deliverables are expected
2. **Define Boundaries:** Clearly understand what was NOT requested or mentioned
3. **Research Context:** Study how similar requests have been handled in this project
4. **Follow Patterns:** Use existing conventions and approaches without modification
5. **Stick to Scope:** Create only what was explicitly requested
6. **No Assumptions:** If something is unclear, ask for clarification rather than guessing

This principle ensures that users get exactly what they asked for, following the project's established way of doing things, without unwanted additions or interpretations.

# 💡 Concept: Feedback Strategies
> 💡 *A clear and concise description of how feedback is gathered and processed in this framework.*

This framework uses a systematic, question-driven approach to gather feedback and refine artifacts. The primary strategy for this is **Question Mode**, which ensures that all ambiguities are resolved through targeted, binary questioning.

## Mode Description
You are operating in Strategic Question Mode, designed to systematically refine and improve projects through targeted YES/NO questioning. This mode uses five question types (Simplify, Clarify, Improve, Expand, Reduce) to drive toward specific, measurable goals while minimizing cognitive load through binary decisions.

## Goal Establishment Phase

**CRITICAL: Always establish a specific, actionable goal first**

<instruction>
Upon activation, immediately:
1. Identify the user's implicit goal from their request
2. Transform it into a specific, measurable objective
3. Present the interpreted goal for confirmation
4. Allow goal adjustment at any time via "change goal to..."
</instruction>

### Goal Specificity Examples
- ❌ Vague: "Refine the issue"
- ✅ Specific: "Ensure we haven't missed any edge cases in error handling"
- ✅ Specific: "Validate all user requirements are technically feasible"
- ✅ Specific: "Identify MVP features vs nice-to-haves for sprint planning"

## Initial Introduction

"Welcome to Strategic Question Mode! I'll help you achieve your goal through targeted questioning.

**Your Goal:** {{specific-goal}}
(Say 'change goal to...' to update this anytime)

**Select questioning approach:**
1. **Single** - One question at a time, alternating types
2. **Batch-5** - 5 questions at once (one of each type)
3. **Document** - Comprehensive checklist in markdown

Which approach would you prefer? (1/2/3)"

## Five Core Question Types

**CRITICAL: All questions MUST be YES/NO format to reduce cognitive load**

### 🔄 Simplify
**Purpose:** Reduce complexity and find elegant solutions
**Pattern:** "Can we simplify by [specific approach]?"
**Focus:** Removing unnecessary complexity, combining steps, streamlining processes
**Example Breakdown:** Instead of "How should we simplify?" ask:
- "Can we combine these two steps?"
- "Should we remove this feature?"
- "Would a single interface work better than three?"

### ❓ Clarify
**Purpose:** Validate understanding and resolve ambiguity
**Pattern:** "Does [X] mean [specific interpretation]?"
**Focus:** Confirming assumptions, defining terms, aligning expectations
**Example Breakdown:** Instead of "What does this mean?" ask:
- "Does 'user' refer to end-users?"
- "Is this a hard requirement?"
- "Should this work offline?"

### 🔧 Improve
**Purpose:** Enhance existing elements
**Pattern:** "Should we improve [X] with [specific enhancement]?"
**Focus:** Optimization, quality enhancement, better approaches
**Example Breakdown:** Instead of "How to improve?" ask:
- "Should we add caching here?"
- "Would TypeScript improve maintainability?"
- "Should we upgrade to the latest version?"

### ➕ Expand
**Purpose:** Identify missing requirements or features
**Pattern:** "Do we need [specific addition]?"
**Focus:** Completeness, edge cases, additional considerations
**Example Breakdown:** Instead of "What's missing?" ask:
- "Do we need error handling for network failures?"
- "Should we support mobile devices?"
- "Do we need audit logging?"

### ➖ Reduce
**Purpose:** MVP analysis and scope management
**Pattern:** "Can we defer [X] to later?"
**Focus:** Essential vs nice-to-have, core functionality, resource optimization
**Example Breakdown:** Instead of "What to cut?" ask:
- "Is authentication required for MVP?"
- "Can we launch without analytics?"
- "Should we postpone multi-language support?"

## Operating Modes

### Mode 1: Single Question Flow
<constraints>
- Present ONE YES/NO question at a time
- Rotate through all 5 types systematically
- Wait for answer before next question
- Track progress toward goal after each answer
- Break complex topics into multiple YES/NO questions
- Use A/B markdown checkboxes vertically aligned
</constraints>

```
Current Type: [Simplify/Clarify/Improve/Expand/Reduce]
Progress: [2/10 questions answered]
Goal Progress: [30% - Still need to address X, Y, Z]

Question: [YES/NO question based on current type]

- [ ] A. Yes
- [ ] B. No
```

### Mode 2: Batch-5 Questions
<constraints>

- ALWAYS show how answers advance the goal
- ALWAYS maintain single questions document per context
- ALWAYS format questions as YES/NO only
- ALWAYS use A/B checkbox format vertically aligned
- ALWAYS break complex questions into multiple YES/NO questions

### 👎 Never  
- NEVER proceed without confirming specific goal
- NEVER ask vague or open-ended questions
- NEVER skip question types in batch mode

```

1. **UNDERSTAND - Core Prompt Philosophy:** Apply the modular structure principle:
   - Every prompt starts with a clear End Goal - the north star
   - Only include sections that directly contribute to that goal
   - Components are: End Goal → Persona → Request → Workflow → Instructions → Output Format
   - Each component is optional except End Goal and Request
   - Follow the evolution path: Inline → Extract → Modularize → Reuse

2. **ANALYZE - Extract Requirements:** Parse the user's request to:
   - Identify the core objective and measurable outcome
   - Determine which prompt variant is needed (create/update/make)
   - Map complexity to component needs
   - Note what's explicit vs. what needs clarification
   - Identify opportunities for component reuse

3. **APPLY - Modular Structure:** Follow @templates/meta/prompt-template.md exactly:
   - **End Goal**: Clear, measurable objective (always required)
   - **Persona**: Only if specialized expertise enhances outcome
   - **Request**: Verb-first activity with clear scope (always required)
   - **Workflow**: Only for multi-step processes with atomic steps
   - **Instructions**: Only for event-driven rules that prevent failure
   - **Output Format**: Only if specific structure improves usability

4. **DETERMINE - Variant Selection:** Choose the appropriate prompt type:
   - **Create** (`/plx:create`): New artifacts from requirements
   - **Update** (`/plx:update`): Enhance existing artifacts
   - **Make** (`/plx:make`): Transform content into artifacts
   - **CMU** (`/plx:create-cmu-prompts`): Complete family of three variants

5. **OPTIMIZE - Component Extraction:** Identify reusable components:
   - Extract personas when expertise is specialized and reusable
   - Extract workflows when processes repeat across prompts
   - Extract instructions when rules apply broadly
   - Use wikilinks for references: `[[component-wl-example]]`
   - Use embedded wikilinks for inclusion: `![[component-name-wl-example]]` (must be on own line)

6. **REFINE - Iterative Improvement:** When using create/update processes:
   - Ask ONE focused question at a time
   - Provide A/B options when helpful
   - Show complete prompt draft after each answer
   - Continue until user confirms readiness

7. **VALIDATE - Quality Checks:** Before finalizing:
   - Verify End Goal is clear and measurable
   - Confirm only contributing sections included
   - Check Request starts with a verb
   - Ensure WikiLinks are properly formatted
   - Validate against @templates/meta/prompt-template.md

8. **DELIVER - Create Artifacts:** Write complete prompts to files:
   - Follow naming: @prompts/[verb-subject].md`
   - Include YAML frontmatter when needed
   - Never output prompts directly in chat
   - Provide usage guidance and integration notes

- **Extraction Paralysis**: Keep inline if >2 minutes deciding

### Rollback Procedures
1. **Phase-Level Rollback**: Return to previous phase output
2. **Component Rollback**: Remove questionable components
3. **Structure Rollback**: Reset to template baseline

# 📝 Prompt Conventions
> 💡 *Established patterns and standards for creating modular, reusable prompts that follow the framework philosophy.*

## Naming Conventions

### File Naming Pattern
All prompt files follow the **verb-subject** pattern with kebab-case:
- `create-feature.md` - For creating features
- `update-story.md` - For updating stories  
- `analyze-performance.md` - For analyzing performance
- `transform-data.md` - For transforming data

### Special Naming Patterns
- **CMU Variants**: `create-[subject].md`, `update-[subject].md`, `make-[subject].md`
- **Meta Prompts**: `create-prompt.md`, `update-template.md`, `make-workflow.md`
- **Generic Utility Prompts**: `help.md`, `clarify.md`, `simplify.md`

### WHEN naming prompt files
- ALWAYS start with a verb (create, update, make, analyze, transform, etc.)
- ALWAYS use kebab-case for multi-word names
- ALWAYS keep names concise but descriptive
- NEVER use underscores or spaces
- NEVER start with nouns

## Directory Organization

### Standard Structure
```
prompts/
├── create-*.md          # Creation prompts
├── update-*.md          # Update/enhancement prompts
├── make-*.md            # Transformation prompts
├── analyze-*.md         # Analysis prompts
├── generate-*.md        # Generation prompts
├── validate-*.md        # Validation prompts
└── [verb]-*.md          # Other action prompts
```

### WHEN organizing prompts
- ALWAYS place in the root @prompts/` directory
- ALWAYS group by verb prefix when listing
- NEVER create subdirectories for categories
- NEVER mix non-prompt files in the directory

## Component Extraction Conventions

### Evolution Path
Follow the standard progression:
1. **Inline**: Define all components within the prompt
2. **Extract**: Move reusable parts to separate files
3. **Reference**: Use `[[wikilinks-wl-example]]` for references
4. **Embed**: Use `![[wikilinks-wl-example]]` for content inclusion

### Extraction Criteria
Extract a component when:
- It's used in 3+ prompts
- It represents specialized expertise (→ persona)
- It's a complex multi-step process (→ workflow)
- It defines reusable rules (→ instructions)
- It specifies output structure (→ output format)

### WHEN extracting components
- ALWAYS extract to the appropriate directory
- ALWAYS use descriptive names for extracted files
- ALWAYS update all prompts using the component
- NEVER extract single-use components
- NEVER create circular dependencies

## 📏 Wikilink Rules
> 💡 *Specific ALWAYS and NEVER rules that must be followed without exception.*

### 👍 Always

- WHEN referencing project documents ALWAYS use wikilinks WITHOUT backticks to reference other relevant project documents.
  - Example: [[relevant-document-wl-example]]
- WHEN creating example wikilinks that don't reference real files ALWAYS end them with "-wl-example".
  - Example: [[filename-wl-example]]
  - Example: ![[embedded-content-wl-example]]
- WHEN using embedded wikilinks ALWAYS place `![[filename-wl-example]]` on its own line.
  - The entire line gets replaced with file content during sync
- WHEN creating templates/prompts ALWAYS remember embedded wikilinks replace the entire line.

### 👎 Never

- WHEN creating wikilinks NEVER use backticks around wikilinks.
  - Wrong: `[[document-wl-example]]`
  - Right: [[document-wl-example]]
- WHEN using embedded wikilinks NEVER place them inline with other text.
  - Wrong: Some text ![[embedded-content-wl-example]] more text
  - Right: 
    ```
    Some text
    ![[embedded-content-wl-example]]
    More text
    ```
- WHEN creating artifacts NEVER forget embedded wikilinks must be on separate lines.

### 🔄 WikiLink Processing Details

**Regular wikilinks** `[[filename-wl-example]]`:
- Converted to `@full/path` references during sync
- Used for referencing other documents
- Processed by `sync-claude-code-wikilinks.sh`

**Embedded wikilinks** `![[filename-wl-example]]`:
- Entire line replaced with file content during sync
- Used for including content from another file
- Processed by `sync-claude-code-embedded-wikilinks.sh`
- MUST be on their own line - the entire line gets replaced

### ✅ Good WikiLink Examples

#### Regular WikiLink Reference
```markdown
For more details, see [[agent-template-wl-example]] for the standard structure.
The [[template-rules-wl-example]] define formatting standards.
```

#### Embedded WikiLink (Content Inclusion)
```markdown
## Instructions

Follow these core instructions:

![[standard-instructions-wl-example]]

Additional project-specific steps:
1. [First step]
2. [Second step]
```

### ❌ Bad WikiLink Examples

#### Never Wrap in Backticks
```markdown
# Wrong
See `[[agent-template-wl-example]]` for details.

# Right
See [[agent-template-wl-example]] for details.
```

#### Never Use Embedded WikiLinks Inline
```markdown
# Wrong
The instructions are: ![[standard-instructions-wl-example]] and then continue.

# Right
The instructions are:

![[standard-instructions-wl-example]]

And then continue.
```

## YAML Frontmatter Standards

### Required Fields
```yaml
---
name: verb-subject
description: "Clear description of what this prompt achieves."
---
```

### WHEN adding frontmatter
- ALWAYS include name and description
- ALWAYS wrap description in quotes
- ALWAYS use kebab-case for name
- NEVER skip frontmatter in prompts
- NEVER use special characters in name field

## Modular Philosophy Implementation

### Component Inclusion Criteria
Only include a component if it:
1. Directly contributes to the End Goal
2. Improves outcome quality measurably
3. Prevents common failures
4. Cannot be achieved without it

### Section Priority
1. **End Goal** - Always required, defines everything
2. **Request** - Always required, the core action
3. **Persona** - Optional, only if expertise matters
4. **Workflow** - Optional, only if multi-step
5. **Instructions** - Optional, only if rules prevent failure
6. **Output Format** - Optional, only if structure matters

### WHEN implementing modularity
- ALWAYS start with End Goal
- ALWAYS evaluate each section against End Goal
- ALWAYS document why sections are included
- NEVER include sections by default
- NEVER add sections just because template has them

# 🌟 Prompt Best Practices
> 💡 *Industry standards and proven approaches for creating high-quality, maintainable prompts.*

## Start with End Goal

### Define Success First
The End Goal is your north star - it determines whether any other section should exist. Write it as:
- Specific and measurable
- Outcome-focused, not process-focused
- Clear enough that success is unambiguous
- Concise but complete

### Example End Goals
- ✅ "Generate production-ready Flutter widget tests with 100% coverage"
- ✅ "Transform user stories into technical implementation plans"
- ❌ "Help with testing" (too vague)
- ❌ "Follow the testing process" (process, not outcome)

### WHEN defining End Goals
- ALWAYS make them measurable
- ALWAYS focus on the outcome
- ALWAYS keep them concise
- NEVER include process steps
- NEVER leave ambiguity

## Apply Ruthless Modularity

### Include Only What Contributes
Each section must pass the contribution test:
1. Does this section help achieve the End Goal?
2. Would the prompt fail without it?
3. Does it add more value than complexity?

If any answer is "no", exclude the section.

### Component Decision Framework
```
Persona:
- ✅ Include if: Specialized expertise improves outcome
- ❌ Exclude if: General knowledge suffices

Workflow:
- ✅ Include if: Multi-step process with dependencies
- ❌ Exclude if: Single action or simple task

Instructions:
- ✅ Include if: Specific rules prevent common failures
- ❌ Exclude if: Obvious or redundant with Request

Output Format:
- ✅ Include if: Specific structure required
- ❌ Exclude if: Standard text response works
```

### WHEN evaluating components
- ALWAYS test against End Goal
- ALWAYS document inclusion rationale
- ALWAYS prefer exclusion when uncertain
- NEVER include components by default
- NEVER add sections "just in case"

## Structure for Clarity

### Use Verb-First Requests
Start every Request section with an action verb:
- "Create comprehensive test suites..."
- "Analyze performance metrics..."
- "Transform raw data into..."
- "Generate documentation for..."

### Write Atomic Workflow Steps
Each workflow step should be:
- **Atomic**: Cannot be broken down further
- **Testable**: Has clear success criteria
- **Independent**: Can be understood in isolation
- **Deliverable-focused**: Produces specific output

### WHEN structuring prompts
- ALWAYS use clear section headers
- ALWAYS follow the template order
- ALWAYS include visual hierarchy (headers, bullets)
- NEVER mix section types
- NEVER skip standard headers

## Optimize for Reusability

### Extract at the Right Time
Follow the extraction timeline:
1. **First use**: Keep inline
2. **Second use**: Consider extraction
3. **Third use**: Extract to file
4. **Multiple variants**: Create agent

### Design Generic Components
When extracting, make components:
- Parameterizable via variables
- Context-independent
- Self-contained
- Well-documented
- Version-controlled

### WHEN extracting components
- ALWAYS wait for pattern emergence
- ALWAYS generalize for reuse
- ALWAYS document parameters
- NEVER extract single-use components
- NEVER create unnecessary dependencies

## Use Effective Language

### Write with Precision
- Use specific, technical terms
- Avoid ambiguous phrases
- Define acronyms on first use
- Provide examples for clarity
- Use consistent terminology

### Apply Positive Framing
Instead of "don't" statements, use positive instructions:
- ✅ "Always validate input before processing"
- ❌ "Don't forget to validate input"
- ✅ "Include error handling for all operations"
- ❌ "Never skip error handling"

### WHEN writing prompt content
- ALWAYS use active voice
- ALWAYS be specific and concrete
- ALWAYS provide examples
- NEVER use ambiguous language
- NEVER assume context

## Implement Smart WikiLinks

### Strategic Component Embedding
Embed components that:
- Are stable and well-tested
- Used across multiple prompts
- Represent complete units
- Have clear boundaries

### Maintain Link Hygiene
- Verify all links before committing
- Use descriptive link names
- Document what each link provides
- Keep embedded links on separate lines
- Test after sync

### WHEN implementing wikilinks
- ALWAYS verify target exists
- ALWAYS use exact file names
- ALWAYS place embeds on separate lines
- NEVER use broken links
- NEVER embed unstable components

## Apply Systematic Refinement

### Use Question-Mode Effectively
Apply all five question types:
1. **Simplify**: Can components be combined or removed?
2. **Clarify**: Are all requirements unambiguous?
3. **Improve**: What would increase quality?
4. **Expand**: What edge cases need coverage?
5. **Reduce**: What can be deferred to MVP?

### Iterate with Purpose
- First pass: Get it working
- Second pass: Make it clear
- Third pass: Make it reusable
- Fourth pass: Optimize and extract

### WHEN refining prompts
- ALWAYS apply all question types
- ALWAYS test against use cases
- ALWAYS seek external review
- NEVER over-optimize
- NEVER skip validation

## Test Conceptually

### Mental Execution
Before finalizing, mentally run through:
1. Can each step be executed?
2. Are success criteria measurable?
3. Do components work together?
4. Are edge cases handled?
5. Is the output format clear?

### Validation Scenarios
Test the prompt against:
- Happy path execution
- Error conditions
- Edge cases
- Resource constraints
- User variations

### WHEN testing prompts
- ALWAYS validate mentally first
- ALWAYS test edge cases
- ALWAYS verify output format
- NEVER assume correctness
- NEVER skip validation

## Document Evolution

### Track Component Journey
Document the evolution:
```markdown
## Evolution History
- v1.0: Inline implementation
- v1.1: Extracted workflow to @workflows/feature-workflow.md
- v1.2: Extracted persona to [[domain-expert]]

# Usage Notes

## Modularity Principle
Every section and subsection is **optional** and should only exist if it directly contributes to achieving the End Goal. Before including any section, ask: "Does this improve our chances of reaching the desired outcome?"

## WikiLink Embedding
Sections can be extracted and embedded as reusable components:
- `![[persona-name-wl-example]]` - Embed a reusable persona
- `![[workflow-name-wl-example]]` - Embed a standard workflow
- `![[instructions-name-wl-example]]` - Embed common instructions
- `![[output-format-name-wl-example]]` - Embed standard output format

**Important:** WikiLinks must be on their own line - the entire line gets replaced during sync.

## Agent Composition
Agents can be composed from:
- Persona (defines expertise)
- Workflow (defines process)
- Instructions (defines rules)
- Output Format (defines delivery)

## Template Blocks
Templates use blocks for inspiration only - examine patterns but create complete content.

## Example Implementations

### Minimal Prompt (End Goal + Request Only)
```markdown
## 🎯 End Goal
