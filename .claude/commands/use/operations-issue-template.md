# 🔧 Operations Issue: [Process/System Name]
> 💡 *Clear description of the operational challenge and its impact on business efficiency.*

[Brief description of what's not working and why it matters]

---

## 📝 Initial Requirement
> 💡 *What operational capability or improvement is needed?*

### Requirements
[List specific operational needs as simple statements]

```
<example>
- [Process efficiency requirements, automation needs, quality standards]
- [Resource optimization needs, capacity requirements, throughput targets]
- [Compliance requirements, safety standards, regulatory needs]
- [Cost reduction targets, waste elimination, productivity improvements]
- [...]
</example>
```

---

## 🌊 Process Flow
> 💡 *How does the current process work vs. how it should work?*

### Current State → Desired State
[Map the transformation from problem to solution]

```
<example>
1. **Current**: [Manual process, inefficient workflow, resource bottleneck]
   - Problem: [Time waste, errors, delays, costs]
2. **Transition**: [Implementation step, process change, new tool/system]
   - Action: [Specific change to make]
3. **Desired**: [Automated process, optimized workflow, resolved bottleneck]
   - Result: [Time saved, errors reduced, efficiency gained]
- [More state transitions as needed]
- [...]
</example>
```

---

## 📦 Deliverables
> 💡 *What needs to be created, changed, or eliminated?*

### Operational Changes
[List tangible changes to processes, systems, or resources]

```
<example>
### Process Changes
- **Create**: [New SOPs, workflows, checklists, automation scripts]
- **Update**: [Existing procedures, training materials, systems]
- **Remove**: [Redundant steps, bottlenecks, waste]

### Resource Changes
- **Acquire**: [Tools, equipment, software, personnel]
- **Reallocate**: [Staff responsibilities, budget, time]
- **Eliminate**: [Unnecessary resources, redundant tools]

[More categories as needed]
[...]
</example>
```

---

## ✅ Success Criteria
> 💡 *How do we measure operational improvement?*

### Performance Metrics
[Define measurable outcomes]

```
<example>
- [ ] [Efficiency metrics: cycle time, throughput, utilization rates]
- [ ] [Quality metrics: error rates, defect counts, compliance scores]
- [ ] [Cost metrics: operational costs, cost per unit, ROI]
- [ ] [People metrics: productivity, satisfaction, safety incidents]
- [ ] [...]
</example>
```

### Operational Standards
[Define what good operations look like]

```
<example>
- [ ] [Process runs without manual intervention, scales with demand]
- [ ] [Quality standards consistently met, compliance maintained]
- [ ] [Resources optimally utilized, waste minimized]
- [ ] [Team knows their roles, documentation updated]
- [ ] [...]
</example>
```

## 🎯 Implementation Checkpoints
> 💡 *Phased approach to operational improvement*

### Checkpoint Planning
[Break down implementation into manageable phases]

```
<example>
### Phase 1: Quick Wins [Week 1-2]
**Focus:** [Immediate improvements with minimal investment]
**Actions:** [Remove obvious bottlenecks, fix broken processes]
**Deliverables:** [Updated procedures, initial training]
**Success:** [20% efficiency gain, team buy-in achieved]

### Phase 2: Core Changes [Week 3-6]
**Focus:** [Major process improvements and system changes]
**Actions:** [Implement new tools, redesign workflows]
**Deliverables:** [New systems operational, staff trained]
**Success:** [50% of target improvements achieved]

### Phase 3: Optimization [Week 7-8]
**Focus:** [Fine-tuning and continuous improvement]
**Actions:** [Monitor, measure, adjust]
**Deliverables:** [Performance dashboards, improvement culture]
**Success:** [Full targets met, sustainable operations]
</example>
```

### Risk Mitigation
[Identify and address operational risks]

```
<example>
- **Risk**: [Process disruption during transition]
  - **Mitigation**: [Parallel running, phased rollout, rollback plan]
- **Risk**: [Staff resistance to change]
  - **Mitigation**: [Training, communication, incentives]
- [More risks and mitigations]
- [...]
</example>
```
