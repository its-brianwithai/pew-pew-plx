## 🔄 Workflow
> 💡 *Systematic phases that discover needs and assemble the perfect starting point.*

### Phase 1: Project Context & Goal Discovery
**Deliverable:** Clear understanding of the project and what the user wants to achieve
**Acceptance Criteria:** User confirms we understand their context and goal

**Process:**
1. Research project context deeply:
   - Run `tree -L 2` to map project structure
   - Read README.md and key documentation files
   - Identify project type, framework, and conventions
   - Find existing components relevant to user's domain
   
2. Extract the user's specific action:
   - Ask: "What action do you want to perform?" (create, analyze, transform, etc.)
   - Get the exact input → output transformation
   - Identify the actor performing the action
   
3. Define measurable success:
   - Document what gets produced
   - Specify how to verify completion
   - Set clear acceptance criteria
   
4. Refine through targeted questions:
   - Ask about critical constraints only
   - Focus on must-have requirements
   - Identify potential failure points
   - Stop when action is clear

**Dynamic Question Generation:**
- Start with understanding the project type
- Explore the desired action or transformation
- Discover what makes this successful
- Let each answer reveal the next question

### Phase 2: Component Discovery & Selection
**Deliverable:** Minimal set of components that achieve the goal
**Acceptance Criteria:** Only necessary components selected, no bloat

After user satisfaction with Phase 1:

**Process:**
1. Discover reusable components in the project:
   - Use `tree`, `ls`, `find` to discover project structure
   - Read `.pew/plx.yaml` if it exists for framework configuration
   - Identify component types (agents, workflows, templates, instructions, etc.)
   
2. Analyze which components would actually help:
   - Does specialized expertise improve outcome? → Look for agents/personas
   - Is this a multi-step process? → Look for workflows/processes
   - Are there critical rules or pitfalls? → Look for instructions/conventions
   - Does output need specific structure? → Look for templates/formats
   
3. Research and select only valuable components:
   - Search discovered locations for relevant pieces
   - Read component descriptions to verify usefulness
   - Reference using actual paths prefixed with @ and without backticks
     - Example: @README.md
   - Keep selections minimal and purposeful
   
4. Assemble only what adds value
5. Keep components modular and independent

### Phase 3: Request & Activity Definition
**Deliverable:** Clear verb-first request
**Acceptance Criteria:** Request precisely defines the activity

**Process:**
1. Define the core verb-first activity
2. Add deliverables/criteria only if needed

### Phase 4: Clean Assembly
**Deliverable:** Focused prompt with only necessary components
**Acceptance Criteria:** Maximum clarity, no bloat

**Process:**
1. Start with End Goal and Request (always required)
2. Add other components only if they demonstrably help
3. Use actual project paths for references
4. Strip redundant content

### Phase 5: Final Validation & Delivery
**Deliverable:** Production-ready prompt with improvement suggestions
**Acceptance Criteria:** User has prompt and knows how to enhance it

**Process:**
1. Present complete prompt for review
2. Validate all components contribute to goal
3. Ensure project conventions are followed
4. Provide improvement suggestions:
   - Information gaps we couldn't infer
   - Missing documentation to research
   - Best practices not found in project
   - Context that would enhance the prompt
5. Offer delivery options:
   - Display in chat
   - Save to local markdown file
   - Copy to clipboard
6. Provide usage instructions and enhancement tips

## 📏 Instructions
> 💡 *Event-driven best practices, conventions, constraints and rules.*

### WHEN generating questions dynamically
**Best Practices:**
- Analyze what information would be most valuable next
- Frame questions to reveal requirements naturally
- Use low cognitive load, often A/B format
- Build progressively on previous answers

**Critical Thinking Process:**
1. Review what's been discovered
2. Identify the biggest gap in understanding
3. Formulate a question that reveals that information
4. Ensure the question is contextually relevant
5. Make it specific to the actual need

**Rules:**
- MUST think about context before asking
- ALWAYS base questions on actual gaps

### WHEN researching project components
**Discovery Process:**
1. Check `.pew/plx.yaml` for PLX framework configuration
2. If not found, do thorough research to find components
3. Look for these component types in various locations:
   - **Agents**: Behavioral expertise modules
   - **Workflows**: Multi-phase processes
   - **Templates**: Structured document formats
   - **Instructions**: Rules, conventions, best practices
   - **Personas**: Character/role definitions
   - **Blocks**: Reusable content sections
   - **Prompts**: Verb-first activity specifications
   - **Concepts**: Core ideas and principles

**Common Locations to Check:**
```
# Root level
/agents/, /workflows/, /templates/, /instructions/
/prompts/, /personas/, /blocks/, /concepts/

# Framework folder
/.pew/agents/, /.pew/workflows/, /.pew/templates/

# Other common locations
/src/prompts/, /lib/agents/, /docs/templates/
/config/, /resources/, /assets/
```

**Research Commands:**
```bash
# Find component folders
find . -type d -name "agents" -o -name "workflows" -o -name "templates"

# Check for PLX config
ls -la .pew/plx.yaml

# Explore structure
tree -L 2 -d

# Search for specific components
ls -la */agents/ */workflows/ */templates/
```

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS verify actual locations first
- USE paths discovered in the project
