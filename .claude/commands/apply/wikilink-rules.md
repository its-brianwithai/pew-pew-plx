## 📏 Wikilink Rules
> 💡 *Specific ALWAYS and NEVER rules that must be followed without exception.*

### 👍 Always

- WHEN referencing project documents ALWAYS use wikilinks WITHOUT backticks to reference other relevant project documents.
  - Example: [[relevant-document-wl-example]]
- WHEN creating example wikilinks that don't reference real files ALWAYS end them with "-wl-example".
  - Example: [[filename-wl-example]]
  - Example: ![[embedded-content-wl-example]]
- WHEN using embedded wikilinks ALWAYS place `![[filename-wl-example]]` on its own line.
  - The entire line gets replaced with file content during sync
- WHEN creating templates/prompts ALWAYS remember embedded wikilinks replace the entire line.

### 👎 Never

- WHEN creating wikilinks NEVER use backticks around wikilinks.
  - Wrong: `[[document-wl-example]]`
  - Right: [[document-wl-example]]
- WHEN using embedded wikilinks NEVER place them inline with other text.
  - Wrong: Some text ![[embedded-content-wl-example]] more text
  - Right: 
    ```
    Some text
    ![[embedded-content-wl-example]]
    More text
    ```
- WHEN creating artifacts NEVER forget embedded wikilinks must be on separate lines.

### 🔄 WikiLink Processing Details

**Regular wikilinks** `[[filename-wl-example]]`:
- Converted to `@full/path` references during sync
- Used for referencing other documents
- Processed by `sync-claude-code-wikilinks.sh`

**Embedded wikilinks** `![[filename-wl-example]]`:
- Entire line replaced with file content during sync
- Used for including content from another file
- Processed by `sync-claude-code-embedded-wikilinks.sh`
- MUST be on their own line - the entire line gets replaced

### ✅ Good WikiLink Examples

#### Regular WikiLink Reference
```markdown
For more details, see [[agent-template-wl-example]] for the standard structure.
The [[template-rules-wl-example]] define formatting standards.
```

#### Embedded WikiLink (Content Inclusion)
```markdown
## Instructions

Follow these core instructions:

![[standard-instructions-wl-example]]

Additional project-specific steps:

### ❌ Bad WikiLink Examples

```markdown
# Wrong
See `[[agent-template-wl-example]]` for details.

# Right

```

#### Never Use Embedded WikiLinks Inline
```markdown
