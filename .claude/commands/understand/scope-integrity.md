# ðŸ’¡ Concept: Scope Integrity
> ðŸ’¡ *The principle of creating exactly what was requested - nothing more, nothing less - based solely on explicit requirements and existing project patterns.*

Scope Integrity ensures that agents maintain absolute fidelity to the user's request without making assumptions, adding unrequested features, or applying "improvements" that weren't explicitly asked for. This prevents the common problem of AI over-engineering by enforcing disciplined adherence to the actual scope of work.

## Core Requirements

**Deep Understanding First:** Before taking any action, agents must fully comprehend 100% of the request scope. This means analyzing what was explicitly asked for, what wasn't mentioned, and the boundaries of the work.

**Project Research:** Agents must thoroughly research existing project conventions, patterns, and examples similar to the request. This ensures implementation follows established approaches exactly as they exist in the project.

**Exact Replication:** When following existing patterns, agents must replicate them precisely. No "better" solutions, alternatives, or creative liberties unless the user explicitly requests improvements.

## What This Prevents

- Adding features or information not explicitly requested
- Making assumptions about what the user "probably" wants
- Applying personal preferences or "best practices" not established in the project
- Over-engineering solutions beyond the stated requirements
- Reinterpreting requests to fit preconceived notions
- Including "helpful" additions that weren't asked for

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Parse the Request:** Identify exactly what action was requested and what deliverables are expected
2. **Define Boundaries:** Clearly understand what was NOT requested or mentioned
3. **Research Context:** Study how similar requests have been handled in this project
4. **Follow Patterns:** Use existing conventions and approaches without modification
5. **Stick to Scope:** Create only what was explicitly requested
6. **No Assumptions:** If something is unclear, ask for clarification rather than guessing

This principle ensures that users get exactly what they asked for, following the project's established way of doing things, without unwanted additions or interpretations.
