# ðŸ’¡ Concept: Context Rot Awareness
> ðŸ’¡ *The principle of including only value-adding, non-redundant information in documents to maintain a clean context for AI agents.*

Context Rot Awareness is about making sure that everything in a documentâ€”whether itâ€™s a prompt, an agent, an instruction, or a concept docâ€”adds value to the main goal weâ€™re working toward with that document. If it doesnâ€™t, it shouldnâ€™t be in there.

Also, donâ€™t repeat things. For example, if you explain a rule and say something must **always** happen, you donâ€™t need to also say the opposite must **never** happen. Saying it once is enough.

We do this mainly to prevent agents from getting useless info and to avoid wasting tokens on information thatâ€™s already known or irrelevant.
