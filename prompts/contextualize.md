## üìè Instructions

### WHEN analyzing source documents
**Best Practices:**
- Read thoroughly to understand current state and purpose
- Identify the document's classification within the framework
- Note existing relationships and references
- Look for contextual gaps and missing information

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS understand the source completely before researching
- NEVER make assumptions about document purpose or needs
- MUST identify document type and classification exactly
- ALWAYS preserve existing valuable content without modification
- NEVER add context that wasn't explicitly requested through research
- MUST follow [[scope-integrity]] principles throughout

### WHEN conducting project research
**Best Practices:**
- Use systematic search patterns for each artifact type
- Look for both direct and indirect relationships
- Identify usage examples and patterns
- Document conventions consistently applied across similar artifacts

**Search Patterns by Artifact Type:**
```
<example>
- [Search pattern for specific artifact type]: [What to look for]
- [Related concept identification methods]: [Pattern matching approaches]
- [Convention discovery techniques]: [How to find established patterns]
- [Cross-reference mapping strategies]: [Relationship identification methods]
</example>
```

**Rules:**
- MUST search all relevant artifact types systematically
- ALWAYS document patterns and conventions discovered
- NEVER skip artifact types that might contain relationships
- MUST identify both direct and indirect connections

### WHEN applying question-mode
**Best Practices:**
- Establish specific goal for contextualization improvement
- Use all 5 question types systematically
- Focus on YES/NO questions for clarity
- Track progress toward comprehensive understanding

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS embed complete question-mode process
- MUST resolve all ambiguities discovered
- NEVER skip systematic refinement process
- ALWAYS track progress toward contextualization goals

### WHEN updating source documents
**Best Practices:**
- Preserve existing structure completely - no new sections
- Integrate context within existing paragraphs and explanations
- Weave wikilinks naturally into existing sentences
- Deepen understanding without changing document purpose

**Constraints:**
- MUST update existing files, not create new ones
- CANNOT add new sections, headers, or structural elements
- CANNOT change the fundamental purpose or structure
- MUST work within existing content framework only

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS enhance existing content exactly as it exists, never add new sections
- NEVER create new headers or structural elements
- MUST preserve exact document structure and hierarchy
- ALWAYS integrate context within existing explanations only
- NEVER add improvements or features not explicitly found through research
- MUST follow [[scope-integrity]] - enhance only what exists, nothing more

### WHEN following template and convention rules
**Requirements:**
- Apply all [[template-rules]] for examples and placeholders
- Use single brackets for instructions: [Replace this]
- Use double curly with backticks for variables: `{{variable-name}}`
- Describe example types, never use actual content in examples

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS follow [[template-rules]] exactly
- NEVER violate established wikilink patterns
- MUST ensure embedded wikilinks are on separate lines
- ALWAYS use proper example formatting

## üìä Output Format

### Format Type
Enhanced source document following original structure with contextual additions.

### Enhancement Pattern
```markdown
# Original document structure completely preserved

## Existing Content Enhancement Examples:
- Original: "This concept helps with organization"
- Enhanced: "This concept helps with organization by providing [[systematic-approach-wl-example]] that aligns with the project's [[modularity-principles-wl-example]] as seen in similar implementations like `{{discovered-usage-example}}`"

- Original: "Use this when you need to analyze"
- Enhanced: "Use this when you need to analyze complex requirements, following the same pattern established in [[related-workflow-wl-example]] and applied across `{{project-usage-examples}}`"

[All enhancements work within existing paragraphs, sentences, and bullet points]
```

### Enhancement Guidelines
- NEVER add new sections or headers
- Enhance existing content by deepening explanations and context
- Weave cross-references naturally into existing sentences and explanations
- Enrich existing examples with discovered project patterns
- Improve clarity and depth of existing content only

### Delivery Instructions
